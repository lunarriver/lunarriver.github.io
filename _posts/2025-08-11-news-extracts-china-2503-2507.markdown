### Taiwan Province

#### [2024-04-01 China launches surprise military drills around Taiwan | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/china-launches-surprise-military-drills-around-taiwan)

The publicity around the exercise likely also **has** the US **in mind** – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker and to deter the US from maintaining high levels of support to Taiwan.”

#### [2025-04-02 China military drills targeting Taiwan put region’s security at risk, says US | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/us-says-china-military-drills-targeting-taiwan-put-regions-security-at-risk)

The US has accused China of putting the region’s security at risk after it launched a second day of military drills targeting Taiwan with a **rehearsal** blockade and attack.

“Once again, China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to **exacerbate** tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk,” it said.

On Wednesday a second one was released titled “**paralysis**”.

#### [2025-04-23 Taiwan president will not attend Pope Francis’s funeral](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/taiwan-president-will-not-attend-pope-francis-funeral)

Taiwan’s deputy foreign minister, Wu Chih-chung, had earlier said the government was in talks with the Vatican over Lai’s **attendance**.

Wu was speaking outside Taipei’s **Catholic** **Archdiocese**, where he was accompanying Lai on a visit to pay respects to Francis. Lai did not speak to the press.

China’s relations with the Vatican appeared to improve under Francis, who oversaw controversial agreements with Beijing about the appointments of Catholic **bishops** in China.

Guo was asked about Pope Francis’s repeated wishes that he could visit China and meet leaders, and whether breaking ties with Taiwan was a **prerequisite** for this to ever happen with a future **pontiff**.

#### [2025-04-27 Taiwan cracks down on holders of Chinese ID amid fears over propaganda and espionage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/taiwan-chinese-passport-id-card-crackdown)

The current **furore** began in December, with an online **documentary** revealing local Chinese authorities were secretly offering Chinese IDs to Taiwanese people.

In March Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, announced new measures to counter China’s **malign** efforts.

The opposition accused the government of deporting people without **due process** for views it didn’t like.

The case highlighted “the unique **dilemma** of Taiwan’s existence”, wrote two local academics, Michelle Kuo and Albert Wu.

**Rescinding** hukou can only be done in person, in China. Convicted of unspecified acts of “**inciting** **secession**”, he remains in a Chinese jail.

The MAC deputy head, Liang Wen-chieh, said last week they were demonstrating “utmost **leniency** towards such individuals”. But amid an **outcry** the government announced case-by-case exemptions, including for people who are elderly, haven’t returned to China in more than 10 years, or feared persecution if they did.

During the furore over the deported influencers, academics Kuo and Wu warned that the government “may have **inadvertently** handed Beijing an easy propaganda victory”.

The Guardian’s conversations with people in or close to the government have revealed a **perplexity** over the backlash.

#### [2025-05-08 Taiwan president says country faces similar threat to Europe before WW2](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/taiwan-president-europe-second-world-war)

Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has compared his nation to the European countries **heading for** conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, in a **punchy** speech commemorating the end of the second world war in Europe.

Lai said to a group of foreign **dignitaries** gathered in Taipei.

Wen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said Lai also wanted to show that “Taiwan wants to be a partner, not just a recipient, of western **largesse**”.

#### [2025-05-12 Taiwan ex-president Tsai Ing-wen to visit UK as China ratchets up threats against Taipei](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/tsai-ing-wen-uk-visit-former-taiwan-president)

Tsai was invited by “friends in Britain’s parliament” in a trip that is designed to deepen friendship between Taiwan and Britain, the office said in a statement, adding Tsai, who has a **doctorate** from the London School of Economics, will meet unspecified British politicians.

Tsai had been due to visit London in October last year, but that coincided with a trip to Beijing by British foreign secretary David Lammy at a time when London was trying to reset **strained** ties with China.

Tsai last year visited the **Czech** Republic, France, **Belgium** and Canada, drawing condemnation from Beijing which has repeatedly denounced Tsai as a “separatist”.

China says Taiwan is one of its provinces with no right to the **trappings** of a state, a position Taipei’s government strongly rejects.

#### [2025-05-20 Taiwan president calls for peace and dialogue with China amid heightened military activity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/20/taiwan-president-calls-for-peace-and-dialogue-with-china-amid-heightened-military-activity)

“However, **whilst** our pursuit of peace is sincere, it must not be naive.”

He urged Beijing to restart dialogue with his government on equal terms, “using exchanges to replace **hemming in**, dialogue to replace confrontation”.

“Since taking office, the Lai Ching-te administration has brazenly pursued ‘Taiwan independence’ to serve partisan and personal gain, charging **headlong** down a path of division and confrontation that threatens the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,” it said.

Last week government officials told reporters they couldn’t rule out military drills in the days after Lai spoke, and on Monday the coast guard said Beijing could launch “political warfare” to disrupt public **morale** in Taiwan.

#### [2025-06-04 World won’t forget Tiananmen Square, US and Taiwan say on 36th anniversary of massacre](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/04/world-wont-forget-tiananmen-square-us-and-taiwan-say-on-36th-anniversary-of-massacre)

The date of 4 June remains one of China’s strictest **taboos**, and the Chinese government employs extensive and increasingly sophisticated resources to censor any discussion or acknowledgment of it inside China.

New research from human rights workers has found that the sensitive date also sees heightened **transnational** **repression** of Chinese government critics overseas by the government and its proxies.

The report published on Wednesday by Article 19, a human rights research and **advocacy** group, said that the Chinese government “has engaged in a systematic international campaign of transnational repression targeting protesters critical of the Chinese Communist party,” with Uyghurs, Tibetans and Hongkongers particularly likely to be affected.

The Article 19 researchers found that, with Tiananmen Square vigils **snuffed** out in China, pro-CCP agents appear to be targeting commemorations in other parts of the world.

In 2022, a replica of a statue known as the “Pillar of Shame”, by Danish artist Jens Galschiøt, was **vandalised** in Taipei.

For the last three years a government-sponsored food **carnival** has been held on the site during the week of the anniversary.

Li said he was **compelled** to talk “as a warning to the world”, and also to Taiwan which is facing the threat of Chinese annexation.

#### [2025-06-06 Frequent TikTok users in Taiwan more likely to agree with pro-China narratives, study finds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/frequent-tiktok-users-in-taiwan-more-likely-to-agree-with-pro-china-narratives-study-finds)

TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and fears of it being used to spread pro-CCP propaganda have already resulted in restrictions or threats of **outright** bans in several countries, including the US. In Taiwan, there are rules against TikTok being used on government devices.

He said it could not be ruled out that users were just more **inclined** to agree with such views and so were being fed content that aligned with their interests.

#### [2025-06-11 Four former staff of Taiwan’s ruling party charged with spying for China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/11/four-former-officials-in-taiwans-ruling-party-charged-with-spying-for-china-ntwnfb)

Chinese authorities in May announced small **bounties** for information leading to the capture of 20 Taiwanese nationals they accused of hacking into a Guangzhou tech company, an accusation Taiwan dismissed as false.

#### [2025-06-11 Hong Kong police tell people not to download ‘secessionist’ mobile game](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/11/hong-kong-police-taiwan-mobile-games-reversed-front)

The game, Reversed Front: Bonfire, allows users to “pledge **allegiance**” to various groups linked to locations that have been major flashpoints or targets for China including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, Uyghurs, Kazakhs and Manchuria, in order to “overthrow the communist regime” known as the “People’s Republic”.

While some aspects and place names of the game’s worldview are imagined, the website says the game is “a work of NON-**FICTION**” and “any similarity to actual agencies, policies, or ethnic groups of the PRC China in this game is INTENTIONAL”.

Downloading the game could lead to players being charged with possessing **seditious** material.

The game asks players if Taiwan can stay safe by avoiding provocative action, or if it should “refrain from repeating the same mistakes of the last 30 years which allowed the communists to grow into the **behemoth** today”.

In player descriptions, the game describes the communists as “heavy-handed, reckless and **inept**” and accused of “widespread corruption, **embezzlement**, exploitation, slaughter and **defilement**”.

The developers vowed not to actively filter or review any words or phrases in the game – a **nod** to recent controversies over censorship in Chinese-made or China-related games.

In 2020 Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong, with the city government’s **blessing**, outlawing a broad range of dissenting behaviours as criminal.

#### [2025-06-18 Malfunctions, overreactions and a steep learning curve: wargaming a Chinese attack on Taiwan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/taiwan-war-games-china-attack)

Last week former senior military and government officials from the US, Japan, and Taiwan convened in Taipei for a **tabletop** exercise, led by the Taipei School of Economics and Political Science Foundation.

The exercises highlighted how much the defence of Taiwan hinges on **assumptions**. Such **unequivocal** US support is by no means guaranteed.

The current US administration is still projecting an image of the superpower protector, but the **volatility** of Trump and his team has sparked concern about its continuing support for Taiwan.

“But the lack of **coherence** and clarity in the Trump administration’s Taiwan policy has exacerbated scepticism toward Washington’s support for Taiwan since he won the election last November.”

An attempt to deflect a key decision by saying it was for a country’s president was **chided** by organisers.

“The exercise clearly showed limitations and some **malfunctions**.”

#### [2025-07-17 ‘Preparation is our only option’: sirens wail as Taiwan simulates China attack in city streets](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/17/taiwan-simulates-china-attack-city-streets-urban-warfare-annual-drill)

Usually people in Taipei walk quite slowly. **Notoriously** so.

Cars and buses pulled over in Ximen, and everyone was **ushered** into the nearby metro station.

The annual drills have become increasingly significant in recent years, as China’s leader, Xi Jinping, **forges ahead** with his plans to annex Taiwan as Chinese territory, by force if his current strategy of intimidation and coercion fails. 

This year the drill has been **incorporated** into much larger civilian urban resilience exercises, in partnership with local governments and private companies such as supermarket chains.

The exercises are normally **confined** to military bases, offshore islands, or **cordoned-off** beaches. But this year they have come much closer to the people, with urban warfare simulations in the city streets and on inter-county bridges, **repelling** assaults on airports and installing newly bought Himars multiple-launch rocket systems on the riverside bike path.

More than 20,000 **reservists** were involved in the force’s largest ever mobilisation.

It is thought the estimated 100,000 air raid shelters marked on public safety maps and apps include all known underground spaces such as car parks or **basements**.

It has labelled the drills “**futile**” provocations.

### Tariffs War

#### [2025-04-04 China hits back hard at ‘bullying’ Trump tariffs as global recession fears grow](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/china-donald-trump-tariffs-recession--us-stock-market)

The tariffs “clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of **sluggish** growth,” said the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva.

There was little sign of such moderation in China’s **trenchant** response to the Trump tariffs, however.

Still, in the UK, some economists suggested the tariffs may have only a **modest** impact. 

“And remember there are some decent **tailwinds** for growth this year, notably from government spending.”

#### [2025-04-08 Trump confirms 104% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of unfolding global trade war](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/trump-global-tariffs)

Donald Trump is poised to unleash his trade war with the world on Wednesday, pressing ahead with a **slew** of tariffs on the US’s largest trading partners despite fears of widespread economic damage and calls to reconsider.

The latest tariffs are higher than the 10% **flat rate** imposed on all global imports to the US on Friday last week.

But he again raised the prospect of agreements with countries on Tuesday, **trailing** a potential deal with South Korea.

In a **scathing** editorial, the official state news outlet Xinhua accused the US president of “**naked** **extortion**”.

#### [2025-05-12 Brazil’s president seeks ‘indestructible’ links with China amid Trump trade war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/brazil-china-trade-lula-da-silva-trump)

The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has **heralded** his desire to build “indestructible” relations with China, as the leaders of three of Latin America’s biggest economies flew to Beijing against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s trade war and the **profound** international uncertainty his presidency has generated.

Hours later Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, arrived, making a **beeline** for the Great Wall of China and declaring his desire for the South American country to not “only look one way” towards the US.

Addressing hundreds of Chinese and Brazilian business chiefs in the Chinese capital on Monday, Lula hit out at Trump’s tariffs, saying he could not accept the measures “that the president of the US tried to impose on planet Earth, **from one day to the next**”.

The Brazilian leftist said he hoped to build an “indispensable” relationship with China – already Brazil’s top trading partner – and **heaped** praise on his Communist party hosts as his officials announced $4.6bn (£3.5bn) of Chinese investment in their country.

The visit of the three South American leaders to China underlines the east Asian country’s rapidly growing **footprint** in a region where, over the past 25 years, it has become a **voracious** consumer of commodities such as soybeans, **iron ore** and copper.

The visits also come amid global **jitters** over Trump’s volatile presidency and Latin American anxiety and suspicion over the US president’s plans for a region where he has threatened to “take back” the Panama **canal** – by force if necessary.

“It tells us that countries around the world are willing to go out … to exploit all the opportunities that are there in the international system – and there are many. Because, as America turns away from free trade and as America adopts a policy that is … instead of **transactional**, **predatory** – countries have an incentive to engage with those who are transactional,” Spektor said, pointing to recent trips Lula made to Japan and Vietnam.

#### [2025-05-13 China cautiously welcomes pause in US tariff war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/13/china-cautiously-welcomes-pause-in-us-tariff-war)

After two days of talks between officials in Geneva over the weekend, China and the US agreed to **substantially** lower for the next 90 days the high tariffs each had imposed on the other in a tit-for-tat trade war.

Donald Trump hailed the talks as a “total reset” of the bilateral relationship but China’s responses made it clear that Beijing was still angry, and still blamed the US for **wreaking** economic chaos.

“While we are glad to see the resumption of dialogue, we are also fully prepared for the long-term, complex and **arduous** nature of resolving differences between the two countries,” it said.

On Monday, China’s commerce and finance ministries held discussions with foreign trade representatives about navigating the next three months and **weathering** the shocks of the tariffs.

“He can breathe, but he’s still far from being able to walk **briskly**,” they wrote.

#### [2025-05-22 World’s seven wealthiest countries agree to counter China’s trade practices](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/22/g7-china-trade)

Ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors there had been doubt about whether there would be a final **communique**, given divisions over US tariffs and Washington’s **reluctance** to refer to Russia’s war on Ukraine as illegal.

But after talks that stretched over three days, participants signed a lengthy document that was **devoid** of previous language on fighting climate change, left out their traditional defence of free trade and softened references to the Ukraine war.

“We found common ground on the most **pressing** global issues that we face.”

The **high-profile** gathering of officials from the US, Canada, the UK, Japan, Germany, France and Italy appeared to be more **congenial** than an earlier meeting of G7 foreign ministers in March. That meeting, also in Canada, occurred as Donald Trump was in the middle of threatening **stiff** tariffs on Canada and suggesting it could become the 51st state.

The description of the Ukraine war was **watered down** from the prior G7 statement issued in October, before Trump’s re-election, calling it an “illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine”.

Trump has diminished US support for Ukraine and has made statements suggesting that Kyiv was to blame for the conflict as he tries to **coax** Russia into peace talks.

#### [2025-05-24 As Trump focuses on his trade war, Brazil and China forge closer ties](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/24/as-trump-focuses-on-his-trade-war-brazil-and-china-forge-closer-ties)

Few world leaders can say they’ve been hugged by Xi Jinping, China’s typically **reserved** president.

Now Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, can count himself among the **hallowed** few to have broken the handshake barrier with Chinese leader. Stepping off the stage after giving a speech in Beijing earlier this month, Lula shook Xi’s hand, but the moment swiftly melted into something more **affectionate**.

In Lula’s address to the China-CELAC forum, a dialogue between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries, he condemned US tariffs and said the Latin American region wanted to be “the axis of a multipolar order where the Global South is **duly** represented.”

Lula’s presence at the forum was itself a **coup** for China as it seeks to expand its global influence in Latin America. Lula in particular got a full bells-and-whistles welcome to Beijing, with a military performance in Tiananmen Square including a 21 gun **salute**.

But while Trump’s vision for the global order is still coming into focus, Beijing has for years **trumpeted** the importance of a “multipolar” system of international cooperation. It is a sentiment that Lula echoes.

He wrote: “During the conversation, President Xi **graciously** invited the First Lady and me to visit China, and I reciprocated.”

Its implementation had **faltered** over China’s curbs on critical mineral exports.

#### [2025-07-07 Is Trump tariff deal really a win for Vietnam – or a way of punishing China?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/vietnam-trump-tariff-deal)

However, a 40% tariff will remain for so-called transshipments – a **provision** that is aimed at Chinese companies accused of passing their products through Vietnam, or elsewhere, to avoid US tariffs.

However, this caused the Vietnamese trade surplus with the US to surge, attracting US **ire** and allegations that Vietnam was wrongly acting as a **conduit** for Chinese companies wanting access to the US market.

Vietnam’s manufacturing industry is closely **intertwined** with both the US and China. US exports account for 30% of Vietnam’s GDP, while China is Vietnam’s top import source, relied on for raw materials used to make anything from **footwear** to furniture and electronics.

“China is completely **interwoven** into global supply chains,” says Dan Martin.

It considers the US not only a key export market but a security partner that serves as a counterbalance to China’s **assertiveness**.

However, if Beijing considers that Hanoi is helping Washington constrain it, this risks **antagonising** Vietnam’s northern neighbour.

However the market for cars remains small in Vietnam, where city streets are famously **crammed** with millions of motorbikes.

### Prejudice

In their sights are Chinese officials and workers, who the US intelligence agency hopes to turn against Beijing via some newly released **glossy** videos.

“The information you can provide is important and we value your **insights** on these topics.”

The agency has said it has had previous success **enlisting** Russians.

“Our agency must continue responding to this threat with urgency, creativity, and **grit**, and these videos are just one of the ways we are doing this.”

China’s authorities appear to have implemented an enhanced version of the country’s internet censorship **regime** in the central province of Henan.

Five officials were later punished for abusing the health code system to **quell** the protests.

The emergence of a regional censorship regime in Henan is unusual because it is not a region of China that is normally considered especially **restive** by the Chinese authorities.

Rapid advances in China’s artificial intelligence companies are a **boon** to both the censors and those who wish to **evade** them.

For example, AI can assist in developing more **agile** testing tools for detecting censorship.”

The most vulnerable nations on Earth are facing a “tidal wave” of debt repayments as a Chinese **lending boom** starts to be called in, a new report has warned.

The pressure to repay was putting strain on local funding for health and education as well as climate change **mitigation**.

The loans were largely issued under President Xi Jinping’s signature belt and road initiative (BRI), a state-backed global infrastructure investment programme which has **underwritten** national projects from schools, bridges and hospitals to major roads and shipping and air ports.

The lending **spree** turned China into the largest supplier of bilateral loans, peaking with a total of more than $50bn in 2016 – more than all western creditors combined.

But the practice has raised concerns about Chinese influence and control and drawn accusations that Beijing was seeking to **entrap** recipient nations with unserviceable debt.

China’s government denies accusations it deliberately creates debt traps, and recipient nations have also **pushed back**, saying China was a more reliable partner and offered crucial loans when others refused.

But the situation also put China in a **bind**, pulled between diplomatic pressure to **restructure** unsustainable debt in vulnerable nations and domestic pressure to **recall** loans amid China’s own economic downturn.

In Jiangxi province, for example, footage will be reviewed after the exam and any violations or **misconduct** “dealt with strictly in accordance with relevant regulations”, the state-backed Global Times reports.

Late last month, Chinese authorities also announced stricter entry checks at exam points, **biometric** identification, enhanced screening for digital devices, and radio signal blockers, state media reported.

Reflecting how seriously Chinese society views the gaokao, some cities have postponed disruptive events such as public performances, delayed office starting hours and created **dedicated** priority traffic lanes to ensure students arrive to the test on time.

#### [2025-06-27 Top Chinese general ousted from body that oversees China’s military](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/27/top-chinese-general-miao-hua-ousted-from-body-that-oversees-china-military)

================================================================================================================================================

A top Chinese general has been dismissed from the body that oversees the Chinese military in the latest sign that Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive has reached the highest **echelons** of the armed forces.

Miao Hua, a senior admiral from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) navy, was the director of the political work department of the central military commission (CMC), making him responsible for ideology and loyalty within the armed forces. The six-person CMC is one of the most powerful institutions in China and is headed by Xi himself.

On Friday, a statement from the Chinese government confirmed that Miao had been dismissed. He was suspended last year and placed under investigation for “serious violations of discipline”, a **byword** for corruption. He was expelled from the National People’s Congress, China’s parliament, in April.

The **dismissal** makes Miao one of the highest-ranking CMC officials to be purged since the 1960s, and the latest in a rush of senior military figures targeted.

He Weidong, a vice-chair of the CMC, is also reported to be under investigation.

The CMC is the governing body of the PLA, and oversees China’s coastguard. Xi is the chair of the CMC, as well as being the leader of China’s ruling Communist party (CCP) and the president.

Miao’s dismissal reflects the latest **ructions** in China’s armed forces. Beijing is keen to present an image of strength and stability on the world stage. The purges risk disrupting that image, although at a time when global attention is focused on wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, senior personnel changes in China’s military may garner less attention.

US-China military dialogue, seen as essential for avoiding accidental conflicts, particularly in the Taiwan strait, have been limited under the presidency of Donald Trump, who has also fired several senior military officials. US military representatives travelled to Shanghai for talks in April, but there have been no public signs of high-ranking meetings.

The US and Chinese defence ministers sometimes meet at the Shangri-la Dialogue, an annual defence forum which was held in Singapore last month. But this year China only sent a small, lower-ranking delegation.

In the past two years, Xi has dismissed two defence ministers, Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe; two heads of the PLA’s rocket force, which is responsible for missiles and the nuclear arsenal, and two senior CMC officials. Senior aerospace and defence business leaders have also been removed from a CCP advisory body.

Many of the recent oustings appear to be related to an investigation into corruption in military **procurement**. Li, who was dismissed as defence minister in 2023 and expelled from the CCP last year, previously led the equipment procurement department. Several of his associates from the military and the equipment procurement department were also purged.

Xi took power with a promise to root out corruption in China, vowing to come after both the “tigers and the flies”. Since then, millions of officials have been investigated, and hundreds of thousands reportedly **penalised**, including high-profile people being expelled or **prosecuted**.

Having now ruled for more than a decade, however, many of the senior figures coming into the **crosshairs** of anti-corruption campaigns are people, such as Miao and Li, who Xi had personally appointed, raising questions about his ability to **vet** important appointments.

Speculation that he was under investigation ran **rampant** until October when Beijing announced he had been removed from his post. No reason was given.

#### [2025-07-04 Hong Kong code of conduct will oblige legislators to ‘sincerely support’ Beijing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/04/hong-kong-code-of-conduct-sincerely-support-beijing)

A new **code** of conduct in Hong Kong will require legislators to “sincerely support” Beijing’s jurisdiction on the city and the chief executive, and **prohibits** anything that might “vilify” the government.

The proposal for the new code, introduced on Wednesday, included **tiered** penalties for legislators who breach the code, including **suspension** without payment for the most serious offences.

It **stipulated** that legislators must “sincerely support the central government’s overall jurisdiction while securing the Hong Kong SAR’s special administrative region’s high degree of autonomy”, as well as the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong”, referring to election reforms which ensure that only pro-Beijing candidates can run.

Hong Kong’s governance system has undergone major **overhauls** in recent years, after a crackdown on the city’s pro-democracy movement and politicians saw major interventions by the government in Beijing.

Every major democratic party has **disbanded** or begun the process of disbandment, and thousands of people – including politicians and activists – have been prosecuted under national security laws.

A separate proposal this week flags new prison rules which include only allowing visits pre-approved by the **correctional** services department, would empower the department to consider restrictions on **clergy** visits, and seek rulings to bar visits by specific legal representatives to imprisoned clients.

“In fact, they are using soft means to influence prisoners, intending to incite them to resist the **supervision** of the correctional services department, **arouse** their hatred towards the central government and the SAR government, and even make them become potential risks to national security and public safety after returning to society.”

Senior foreign judges have left or resigned from Hong Kong’s **appeal court**, with several specifically citing concerns over the new environment. Hong Kong authorities reject the claims.

#### [2025-07-07 China’s human rights lawyers speak out, 10 years after crackdown](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/chinas-human-rights-lawyers-speak-out-10-years-after-crackdown)

A decade on from China’s biggest crackdown on human rights lawyers in modern history, lawyers and activists say that the Chinese Communist party’s control over the legal **profession** has tightened, making rights defence work next to impossible.

The environment for human rights law has “steadily **regressed**, especially after the pandemic”, said Ren Quanniu, a **disbarred** human rights lawyer. During that time judicial organs were attacked as “**bourgeois**” and the **nascent** court system was largely suspended.

According to human rights groups and the US government, about 300 people from the loose collective of a **burgeoning** rights defence movement, known as weiquan, were targeted in the **round-up**. At least 10 were convicted of crimes such as “subversion of state power” and given jail terms, while dozens more have been subjected to **surveillance**, harassment and the revocation of their professional licences in the years since.

Lawyers scored wins for defendants in cases ranging from **tainted** baby milk formula scandals to the abuse of migrant workers.

“It’s hard to say we achieved success – we can only say that the services we provided have made it more difficult for the authorities to **persecute** certain groups,” said Jiang Tianyong, a 54-year-old former human rights lawyer known for taking on cases involving religious and ethnic minorities who served two years in prison for “inciting subversion of state power”.

The **daily grind** was not about **promulgating** foreign ideas, said Ren.

Under Xi’s rule, activists have been rounded up, independent law firms and NGOs have been **reined** in, and any kind of organised activity outside the **auspices** of the Communist party (CCP) has been tightly restricted.

“The Chinese government under Xi Jinping has sought to **eradicate** the influence of lawyers who defend people’s rights,” said Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch.

Ren escaped the first wave of **reprisals** after the 709 incident.

Those without licences try to offer **informal** advice to people in need, but their ability is severely limited.

“Although the year of the 709 incident marked a major regression in the rule of law in China … people, I believe, are gradually building resilience, **maturing** and becoming stronger.”

The federal employee works for the US **Patent** and **Trademark** Office, and was visiting China in a **personal capacity**, according to the state department.

Exit bans are a controversial mechanism used by the Chinese government to bar both Chinese citizens and foreigners from leaving, for reasons ranging from criminal investigations to unsettled **civil disputes**, but is also used as a **leverage tool** in diplomatic disputes.

The exact reasons for the federal employee’s exit ban are unclear, but the Washington Post had previously reported that the worker, whose identity has not been released, was stopped from leaving the country after he failed to **disclose** his government employment on the visa application. He reportedly had also served in the US Army.

“Chenyue Mao is involved in a criminal case currently being handled by Chinese **law-enforcement authorities** and is subject to exit restrictions in accordance with the law,” Guo said.

Wells Fargo has since banned all employees from travelling to China since Mao – a **naturalised** US citizen of **Chinese descent** – was stopped from leaving.

A 2023 report by Safeguard Defenders said that since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, “China has expanded the **legal landscape** for exit bans and increasingly used them, sometimes outside legal justification”.

Exit bans have been used against activists and journalists – including foreign **correspondents** – and family members of the people actually of interest to the Chinese government. In 2019 two American siblings were allowed to return home after three years trapped in China. Cynthia and Victor Liu were subject to an exit ban, despite not facing any criminal allegations. Their father, a former bank official and **fugitive** Liu Changming, was wanted in China to face **fraud charges**.

China and the Philippines have displayed their national flags in competing photo opportunities on a disputed **sandbank** in the South China sea, **ratcheting** up longstanding regional tensions between the two countries.

The dispute played out at Sandy Cay, which is part of the disputed Spratly Islands, and comes days after the US and the Philippines launched their annual joint military drills called “Balikatan”, or “shoulder to shoulder”, which this year will include an **integrated** air and missile defence **simulation** for the first time.

The latest confrontation appears to have emerged on Thursday, when Chinese state media reported the Coast Guard landed on the disputed **reef** two weeks ago, **unfurled** a flag and “exercised sovereign jurisdiction”.

On Sunday, China’s coast guard then accused six Filipino personnel of “illegally boarding” Sandy Cay, which Beijing calls Tiexian Reef, earlier that day despite “warnings and **dissuasion**” from the Chinese side.

Sandy Cay is just a few kilometres from Thitu island, where the Philippines maintains a military **outpost**.

“The **facts on the ground** **belie** their statements,” National Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said. “It is not to the benefit of any nation if these things are happening, nor it is to the benefit of any nation if such **irresponsible** announcements and statements are released to the public and to the world.”

Chinese state broadcaster CCTV published a photograph of five **black-clad** people standing on the **uninhabited** reef as a dark inflatable boat **bobbed** in the nearby water. The group also “cleaned up **leftover** plastic bottles, wooden sticks and other debris and garbage on the reef”, the broadcaster reported.

On Saturday Hegseth said China was “**credibly** preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific”, and was rehearsing for “the **real deal**” of invading Taiwan.

“There’s no reason to **sugar coat** it. The threat China **poses** is real, and it could be imminent,” the US defence secretary said in a keynote address at the Shangri-la Dialogue defence forum, calling for Asian countries to increase defence spending.

“Hegseth deliberately ignored the call for peace and development by countries in the region, and instead touted the cold war mentality for bloc confrontation, **vilified** China with **defamatory** allegations, and falsely called China a ‘threat’,” it said.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday morning, Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, rejected the **premise** of China’s criticism of Hegseth.

“What we have seen from China is the single biggest increase in military capability and buildup in a **conventional sense** by any country since the end of the second world war,” he said.

“That is one of the key features of the **complexity** of the strategic landscape which all of us face within the region and which is faced around the world.”

The US is not a **signatory** to that convention.

Past years have often seen the US and China trade **barbs**, but also occasionally hold significant meetings, including last year with China’s defence minister, Dong Jun, and Hegseth’s predecessor, Lloyd Austin.

This year, however, China sent only a small delegation led by a vice-president of the People’s Liberation Army’s national defence university, **Rear Adm** Hu Gangfeng.

Referencing China’s absence, Chan said Beijing should use “every opportunity” available to **get** its position **across**.

“But **regardless of** whether China attends the dialogue, it is **incumbent** on all of us to reach out to China in different forums … to not end up in a situation where either side **misinterprets**, miscalculates, or **misrepresents** each other’s position. That is dangerous.”

The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, did not say if the government had **lodged** a formal protest, saying only that it had “conveyed an appropriate message to the Chinese side”.

The incursion into Pacific waters about 300km south-west of Minamitori island will add to concern in Tokyo and Washington about China’s increasingly **assertive** naval and air activity in and around Japanese waters.

The countries are **embroiled** in a longstanding territorial dispute over the Senkakus – uninhabited islets in the east China Sea that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, where they are known as the Diaoyu.

This is the first time, however, that a Chinese vessel has entered that part of Japan’s EEZ – an area within 200 **nautical** miles (370km) of its coastline – a defence ministry spokesperson told Agence France-Presse.

After leaving the EEZ, the Chinese carrier group conducted **landing and take-off** drills involving fighter jets and helicopters, the ministry said, adding that Japan had deployed a warship, Haguro, to monitor the situation.

Minamitori, the **easternmost** point of the Japanese **archipelago**, is surrounded by large **deposits** of rare metals. Last year, experts from the Nippon Foundation and Tokyo University said about 200m tonnes of **manganese** **nodules** rich in rare metals existed on the seabed near the island.

China installed 93 GW of solar capacity last month – almost 100 solar panels every second, according to an analysis by Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Wind power installations reached 26 GW, the equivalent of about 5,300 **turbines**.

Trump withdrew from many major environmental protection treaties, such as the Paris climate agreement which aims to limit global warming to well below two degrees **celsius** above preindustrial levels.

China is the world’s biggest emitter of **greenhouse gases** but is also the world’s biggest supplier and installer of clean energy technology.

Xi Jinping, China’s leader, is increasingly connecting China’s climate ambitions with the growth of the clean energy technology sector, which he sees as vital to boosting China’s **flagging** economy.

But the **hyper-competitiveness** of China’s economy is also putting pressure on clean energy firms, with prices of solar panels barely covering the cost of production.

The four countries said in a joint statement that they were establishing the Quad Critical Minerals Initiative, aimed at “collaborating on securing and **diversifying**” supply chains.

They offered little detail but made clear the goal was to reduce reliance on China, which has used restrictions **as leverage** as the US in turn curbs its access to semiconductors and threatens steep tariffs.

China holds major reserves of several key minerals including the vast majority of the world’s **graphite**, which is crucial for electric vehicles.

In a joint statement, the Quad countries said: “Reliance on any one country for processing and refining critical minerals and **derivative** goods production exposes our industries to economic coercion, price manipulation and supply chain disruptions.”

Rubio had welcomed the Quad foreign ministers on 21 January in his first meeting after Trump’s inauguration, seen as a sign the new administration would prioritise engagement with **like-minded** countries to counter China.

But to the surprise of many, China has not topped the **early agenda** of Trump, who has spoken respectfully about his counterpart, Xi Jinping, and moved to ease tensions in a wider trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Both the Indian and Japanese foreign ministers said they wanted the Quad to focus on a “free and open Indo-Pacific” – a **phrasing** that is a **veiled** **allusion** to opposing Chinese dominance in Asia.

“It is **essential** that nations of the Indo-Pacific have the freedom of choice, so essential to make right decisions on development and security,” Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said.

At Jaishankar’s urging, the Quad also condemned a May attack on the Indian side of Kashmir that killed mostly Hindu civilians and called for “the **perpetrators**, organisers and financiers of this **reprehensible** act to be brought to justice without any delay”.

In a key concern for Japan, the Quad condemned North Korea for its “destabilising launches” of missiles and insisted on its “complete **denuclearisation**”.

India has maintained its long relationship with Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine, while both India and Japan also have historically enjoyed **cordial** ties with Iran.

Few **break-ups** have as many **gossiping** observers as the fallout between the once **inseparable** Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

The ill-fated bromance between the US president and the world’s richest man, which once raised questions about American **oligarchy**, is now being **pored** over by social media users in China, many of whom are Team Musk.

Musk had already vowed to unseat lawmakers who backed Trump’s **flagship** piece of legislation, which is expected to increase US national debt by $3.3tn.

One comment **summed up** the mood on the platform: “Brother Musk, you’ve got over a billion people on our side backing you.”

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is widely **venerated** in China for his business **acumen** and technological achievements. Tesla’s electric vehicles are the only western brand on Chinese roads that can rival domestic firms, and the company’s biggest factory by volume is in Shanghai. Musk is known to have a close relationship with China’s premier, Li Qiang, while Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, is a social media celebrity **in her own right** in China.

Musk’s popularity in China follows a well-established trend of Chinese audiences **enthusiastically** embracing US tech innovators. Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs was a bestseller in China, as was his biography of Musk.

Trump, however, is seen by many as being an unpredictable funnyman who has launched the most **aggressive** trade war on China in recent history.

Some internet users commented that Trump and Musk should grow up. “These two grown men argue **nonstop** over the smallest things – and the whole world ends up knowing about it,” wrote one user, while another joked: “Every day, Musk is basically live-streaming ‘How Billionaires Argue’”.

The conversation has been allowed to **flourish** on China’s tightly controlled social media, suggesting that at least some censors are betting that the US political chaos could be no bad thing for China.

#### [2025-07-02 Dalai Lama defies China to say successor will be chosen by Tibetan tradition](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/02/dalai-lama-says-there-will-be-search-for-his-successor-ending-years-of-speculation)

The Dalai Lama has declared in a direct challenge to China that the **centuries-old** spiritual institution bearing his name will continue after his death and that only his inner circle, not Beijing, will have the authority to identify his successor.

In a video message played on Wednesday during prayer celebrations ahead of his 90th birthday this weekend, the 14th Dalai Lama said the Gaden Phodrang Trust, which manages his affairs, would oversee the search for his **reincarnation**.

“In accordance with all these requests, I am affirming that the **institution** of the Dalai Lama will continue,” he told the gathering of senior Buddhist monks. He said clear written instructions would be left behind, but did not **elaborate** on their contents.

China annexed Tibet in 1951 and has retained tight control over the region ever since. It has said the choice of the next Dalai Lama lies only with Beijing, and has **enshrined** state **assent** for all senior Tibetan religious leaders in law. It insists the golden **urn** – a Qing dynasty **ritual** in which names are drawn by lot from a ceremonial vessel – is the only legitimate method for recognising reincarnated lamas. The Communist party must approve the final selection.

The boy and his family vanished into Chinese **custody** days later and have not been seen since. China **installed** its own candidate, widely rejected by Tibetans. According to Chinese state media, the Beijing-backed Panchen Lama met President Xi Jinping just last month and pledged loyalty to the Communist party.

Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama is the **earthly** **manifestation** of Avalokiteshvara, a **revered** figure in Buddhism known as the **bodhisattva** of **compassion** – a spiritual being who remains in the world to guide others on the path to **enlightenment**.

By tradition, only the current Dalai Lama, or those he appoints, can identify his successor, using visions, **omens** and consultation with senior lamas and protectors of the faith.

The deputy speaker of the Tibetan parliament in exile, Dolma Tsering Teykhang, said: “The world needs to hear directly from His Holiness. China tries to **vilify** him at every chance … It is trying to frame rules and regulations on how to have the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in their hand.”

“He has been an **enduring** symbol of love, compassion, patience and moral discipline,” he added.

Modi’s **effusive** support is significant.

“We support efforts to preserve Tibetans’ **distinct** **linguistic**, cultural and religious **heritage**, including their ability to freely choose and venerate religious leaders without interference,” the statement added.

Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te – who leads an island that China says is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to seize – said in a statement read at the ceremony that the example set by the Dalai Lama “**resonates** with all who **cherish** freedom, democracy and respect for human rights”.

“At a time when we see the forces of division tearing at the **fabric** of our common humanity … I’m grateful for your enduring efforts to build a better, kinder, more compassionate world,” Bill Clinton said.

On a remote stretch of land in the Cook Islands lies a second world war **airstrip**. Once used as a wartime supply route by American forces, the narrow runway is in **dire** need of **resealing** to allow larger tourist jets to land.

The country of about 17,000 people has seen ties with its biggest ally and former colonial partner New Zealand **fray** as leaders draw it closer to Beijing.

But others, such as the opposition leader, Tina Browne, were **vocal** in their criticism of Beijing building its influence in the Cook Islands.

In the sleepy seaside town, one of the main attractions is standing at the **seawall** to watch planes land.

Fruit and vegetable seller Teremoana Napa spent 40 years living and working in New Zealand before returning to the Cook Islands. She is now on New Zealand’s **pension**.

“The New Zealand passport gives us so much,” she says. “We don’t want a Cook Islands passport, that’s a **bloody** **dead-end** passport.”

Others share concern over the loss of crucial aid from Wellington. Outside the country’s main hospital, Calais Ngatan helps his heavily **pregnant** wife to the car.

The deal signed in February between the Cook Islands and China **encompasses** a series of cooperation agreements designed to support the domestic economy.

The two countries have agreed to collaborate on scientific research, joint **expeditions**, education and training. Powles says there is a “race” for critical minerals for their defence application and for that reason China is “actively engaged in finding opportunities and **formalising** partnerships with countries who are interested in mining their deep-sea minerals within their waters”.

The activity has prompted concern in Rarotonga. Don Beer, head of Cook Islands’ Fishing Association, is firmly opposed to seabed mineral exploration, citing concerns about its potential impact on already declining fish stocks. His **unease** is **compounded** by China’s growing interest not just in minerals but also in the Cook Islands’ **maritime** resources.

Powles says that for Beijing, deepening relations with the Cook Island **shores up** “closer diplomatic ties with Pacific Island partners and that helps to influence and shape a regional order”. From New Zealand’s perspective, she notes, the aid freeze was a sign of just how fragile the relationship has become.

“It is quite an extreme move to pause aid,” she says. “New Zealand has been increasingly clear over the years that, particularly in the security **realm**, that it sees China as a **disruptor** and a destabilising actor in the Pacific.”

Next month, the Cook Islands will mark 60 years of self-government in free association with New Zealand. As preparations for a massive inter-island celebration unfold, the event is **tinged** with diplomatic unease. Cook Islands has invited New Zealand to attend – Wellington says their attendance is still “under consideration”.

At a press briefing in Beijing last month, Foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said China’s cooperation with the Cook Islands “targets no third party, nor should it be **interfered** with or **constrain**ed by any third party”.

A restaurant in northern China has been criticised by animal **welfare** groups for offering an unusual item on the menu: lion **cub** **cuddles**.

According to a screenshot of a menu circulating on social media, Wanhui – a restaurant in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province – has a **four-course** set afternoon menu costing 1,192 yuan ($166/£124) that includes playtime with the in-house animals.

The restaurant’s **profile** on Dazhong Dianping, a popular restaurant listings app, shows pictures of the lion cubs alongside other animals, such as deer and **alligators**.

The menu on the Dianping page does not include lions in its list of animals but says customers can play with **llamas**, turtles and **meerkats**.

Several photos show customers **snuggling** the baby lions.

In one review posted this month, a customer sits with a lion cub on her **lap**, holding the its paw to wave to the camera.

Peter Li, a China policy expert for Humane World for Animals, told Reuters: “Exploiting wild animals for **selfies** and marketing **gimmicks** is not only **appallingly** bad animal welfare, it’s also potentially risky for customers.”

It is not the first **exotic** animal welfare scandal in China. Last month, tourists visiting a zoo in Liaoning, in the north-east, were condemned for reaching through a metal grate to pull tufts of hair off a tiger.

A hotel in Chongqing, a city in south-west China, recently attracted **scorn** for offering a “wake-up service” delivered by red pandas, which could climb into guests’ beds.

Contact between humans and exotic animals has also been highlighted by experts as a potential risk for the spread of **zoonotic** diseases, such as Covid-19.

According to Reuters, the restaurant said the lion cubs were well cared for by **specialist staff**.

Construction of the world’s biggest **hydropower** megadam has begun, China’s premier has said, calling it the “project of the century”.

The dam has drawn criticism from India and **Bangladesh**, through which the river runs, as well as Tibetan groups and environmentalists.

The project announced by Li is planned for the **lower reaches** of the river, according to the official state news outlet, Xinhua. Xinhua reported that the project would consist of five cascade hydropower stations, producing an estimated 300 million **megawatt** hours of electricity annually at a cost of about 1.2tn yuan (£124bn).

In comparison, the Three **Gorges** dam cost 254.2bn yuan and generates 88.2m MWh.

China, the world’s biggest carbon emitter, is operating a huge renewable energy **expansion** as it seeks to reach emissions reduction goals and stabilise its power supply. It has tens of thousands of hydropower projects, far more than any other country.

The Yarlung Tsangpo megadam will reportedly **harness** the power created by the river dropping 2km in about 50km as it winds through a **canyon** on a U-shaped **bend**.

“China can always weaponise this water in terms of blocking it or diverting it,” Neeraj Singh Manhas, **special adviser** for South Asia at the Parley Policy Initiative, told the BBC in January.

Last year hundreds of people were arrested while protesting against the Kamtok dam on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river, which they said threatened to displace thousands of residents and submerge ancient Buddhist **monasteries**. The Three Gorges Dam is estimated to have displaced about 1.5 million people.

Environmentalists have also expressed concern about wildlife in the region, as well as the significant **tectonic** shifting, severe landslides and extreme geography where the dam is expected to go.

The Chinese government rejects the criticism, and says the project will stimulate jobs in the region, increase domestic energy supplies and **spur** on development in the renewables sector. “Special emphasis must be placed on **ecological** **conservation** to prevent environmental damage,” Li said.

Chinese authorities have arrested six people and launched disciplinary investigations into almost 30 others after more than 230 kindergarten children were poisoned by food coloured with industrial-grade **lead paint**.

The incident, which occurred in Gansu province earlier this month, is one of China’s worst school food safety incidents and has drawn national attention. An investigative report released by the Gansu provincial party committee on Sunday found a **litany** of failures in safety and oversight, as well as attempts to **cover up** the incident, **bribe** people in charge and modify test results.

The report said the **principal** at the Tianshui kindergarten had wanted to attract more **enrolments** by “enhancing” the colour and look of the food served to children. The school’s cook bought industrial-grade **pigment** online, adding it to dishes despite the packages saying it was “not for **consumption**”.

Initially, 235 students were hospitalised after eating the coloured food. Local state media quoted a parent at the time saying children had suffered stomach pain and **nausea**, and some children’s teeth had turned black.

It said the Gansu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention **neglected** the case after accepting it, and took samples in a way that violated health regulations and led to a “huge difference” in the test results and the actual levels.

“The management of Tianshui Second People’s hospital and its **laboratory** department was chaotic, job responsibilities were not fully implemented, laboratory quality control was not fully implemented and **relevant** inspection personnel lacked systematic training,” the report said.

It said the children had been treated and all but one had been **discharged** after the first round of treatment, during which lead levels dropped by an average of 40%.

The footage showed officers using physical force, including **batons**, and angry parents confronting individuals in **plain clothes**, questioning their use of violence. As police cars appeared to try to escort the plain-clothed individuals away, parents blocked the road, shouting: “Hand over those who beat people up.”
