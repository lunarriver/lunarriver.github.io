### Taiwan Province

#### [2024-04-01 China launches surprise military drills around Taiwan | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/china-launches-surprise-military-drills-around-taiwan)

The publicity around the exercise likely also **has** the US **in mind** – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker and to deter the US from maintaining high levels of support to Taiwan.”

#### [2025-04-02 China military drills targeting Taiwan put region’s security at risk, says US | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/us-says-china-military-drills-targeting-taiwan-put-regions-security-at-risk)

The US has accused China of putting the region’s security at risk after it launched a second day of military drills targeting Taiwan with a **rehearsal** blockade and attack.

“Once again, China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to **exacerbate** tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk,” it said.

On Wednesday a second one was released titled “**paralysis**”.

#### [2025-04-23 Taiwan president will not attend Pope Francis’s funeral](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/taiwan-president-will-not-attend-pope-francis-funeral)

Taiwan’s deputy foreign minister, Wu Chih-chung, had earlier said the government was in talks with the Vatican over Lai’s **attendance**.

Wu was speaking outside Taipei’s **Catholic** **Archdiocese**, where he was accompanying Lai on a visit to pay respects to Francis. Lai did not speak to the press.

China’s relations with the Vatican appeared to improve under Francis, who oversaw controversial agreements with Beijing about the appointments of Catholic **bishops** in China.

Guo was asked about Pope Francis’s repeated wishes that he could visit China and meet leaders, and whether breaking ties with Taiwan was a **prerequisite** for this to ever happen with a future **pontiff**.

#### [2025-04-27 Taiwan cracks down on holders of Chinese ID amid fears over propaganda and espionage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/taiwan-chinese-passport-id-card-crackdown)

The current **furore** began in December, with an online **documentary** revealing local Chinese authorities were secretly offering Chinese IDs to Taiwanese people.

In March Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, announced new measures to counter China’s **malign** efforts.

The opposition accused the government of deporting people without **due process** for views it didn’t like.

The case highlighted “the unique **dilemma** of Taiwan’s existence”, wrote two local academics, Michelle Kuo and Albert Wu.

**Rescinding** hukou can only be done in person, in China. Convicted of unspecified acts of “**inciting** **secession**”, he remains in a Chinese jail.

The MAC deputy head, Liang Wen-chieh, said last week they were demonstrating “utmost **leniency** towards such individuals”. But amid an **outcry** the government announced case-by-case exemptions, including for people who are elderly, haven’t returned to China in more than 10 years, or feared persecution if they did.

During the furore over the deported influencers, academics Kuo and Wu warned that the government “may have **inadvertently** handed Beijing an easy propaganda victory”.

The Guardian’s conversations with people in or close to the government have revealed a **perplexity** over the backlash.

#### [2025-05-08 Taiwan president says country faces similar threat to Europe before WW2](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/taiwan-president-europe-second-world-war)

Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has compared his nation to the European countries **heading for** conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, in a **punchy** speech commemorating the end of the second world war in Europe.

Lai said to a group of foreign **dignitaries** gathered in Taipei.

Wen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said Lai also wanted to show that “Taiwan wants to be a partner, not just a recipient, of western **largesse**”.

#### [2025-05-12 Taiwan ex-president Tsai Ing-wen to visit UK as China ratchets up threats against Taipei](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/tsai-ing-wen-uk-visit-former-taiwan-president)

Tsai was invited by “friends in Britain’s parliament” in a trip that is designed to deepen friendship between Taiwan and Britain, the office said in a statement, adding Tsai, who has a **doctorate** from the London School of Economics, will meet unspecified British politicians.

Tsai had been due to visit London in October last year, but that coincided with a trip to Beijing by British foreign secretary David Lammy at a time when London was trying to reset **strained** ties with China.

Tsai last year visited the **Czech** Republic, France, **Belgium** and Canada, drawing condemnation from Beijing which has repeatedly denounced Tsai as a “separatist”.

China says Taiwan is one of its provinces with no right to the **trappings** of a state, a position Taipei’s government strongly rejects.

#### [2025-05-20 Taiwan president calls for peace and dialogue with China amid heightened military activity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/20/taiwan-president-calls-for-peace-and-dialogue-with-china-amid-heightened-military-activity)

“However, **whilst** our pursuit of peace is sincere, it must not be naive.”

He urged Beijing to restart dialogue with his government on equal terms, “using exchanges to replace **hemming in**, dialogue to replace confrontation”.

“Since taking office, the Lai Ching-te administration has brazenly pursued ‘Taiwan independence’ to serve partisan and personal gain, charging **headlong** down a path of division and confrontation that threatens the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,” it said.

Last week government officials told reporters they couldn’t rule out military drills in the days after Lai spoke, and on Monday the coast guard said Beijing could launch “political warfare” to disrupt public **morale** in Taiwan.

#### [2025-06-04 World won’t forget Tiananmen Square, US and Taiwan say on 36th anniversary of massacre](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/04/world-wont-forget-tiananmen-square-us-and-taiwan-say-on-36th-anniversary-of-massacre)

The date of 4 June remains one of China’s strictest **taboos**, and the Chinese government employs extensive and increasingly sophisticated resources to censor any discussion or acknowledgment of it inside China.

New research from human rights workers has found that the sensitive date also sees heightened **transnational** **repression** of Chinese government critics overseas by the government and its proxies.

The report published on Wednesday by Article 19, a human rights research and **advocacy** group, said that the Chinese government “has engaged in a systematic international campaign of transnational repression targeting protesters critical of the Chinese Communist party,” with Uyghurs, Tibetans and Hongkongers particularly likely to be affected.

The Article 19 researchers found that, with Tiananmen Square vigils **snuffed** out in China, pro-CCP agents appear to be targeting commemorations in other parts of the world.

In 2022, a replica of a statue known as the “Pillar of Shame”, by Danish artist Jens Galschiøt, was **vandalised** in Taipei.

For the last three years a government-sponsored food **carnival** has been held on the site during the week of the anniversary.

Li said he was **compelled** to talk “as a warning to the world”, and also to Taiwan which is facing the threat of Chinese annexation.

#### [2025-06-06 Frequent TikTok users in Taiwan more likely to agree with pro-China narratives, study finds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/frequent-tiktok-users-in-taiwan-more-likely-to-agree-with-pro-china-narratives-study-finds)

TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and fears of it being used to spread pro-CCP propaganda have already resulted in restrictions or threats of **outright** bans in several countries, including the US. In Taiwan, there are rules against TikTok being used on government devices.

He said it could not be ruled out that users were just more **inclined** to agree with such views and so were being fed content that aligned with their interests.

#### [2025-06-11 Four former staff of Taiwan’s ruling party charged with spying for China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/11/four-former-officials-in-taiwans-ruling-party-charged-with-spying-for-china-ntwnfb)

Chinese authorities in May announced small **bounties** for information leading to the capture of 20 Taiwanese nationals they accused of hacking into a Guangzhou tech company, an accusation Taiwan dismissed as false.

#### [2025-06-11 Hong Kong police tell people not to download ‘secessionist’ mobile game](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/11/hong-kong-police-taiwan-mobile-games-reversed-front)

The game, Reversed Front: Bonfire, allows users to “pledge **allegiance**” to various groups linked to locations that have been major flashpoints or targets for China including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, Uyghurs, Kazakhs and Manchuria, in order to “overthrow the communist regime” known as the “People’s Republic”.

While some aspects and place names of the game’s worldview are imagined, the website says the game is “a work of NON-**FICTION**” and “any similarity to actual agencies, policies, or ethnic groups of the PRC China in this game is INTENTIONAL”.

Downloading the game could lead to players being charged with possessing **seditious** material.

The game asks players if Taiwan can stay safe by avoiding provocative action, or if it should “refrain from repeating the same mistakes of the last 30 years which allowed the communists to grow into the **behemoth** today”.

In player descriptions, the game describes the communists as “heavy-handed, reckless and **inept**” and accused of “widespread corruption, **embezzlement**, exploitation, slaughter and **defilement**”.

The developers vowed not to actively filter or review any words or phrases in the game – a **nod** to recent controversies over censorship in Chinese-made or China-related games.

In 2020 Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong, with the city government’s **blessing**, outlawing a broad range of dissenting behaviours as criminal.

#### [2025-06-18 Malfunctions, overreactions and a steep learning curve: wargaming a Chinese attack on Taiwan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/taiwan-war-games-china-attack)

Last week former senior military and government officials from the US, Japan, and Taiwan convened in Taipei for a **tabletop** exercise, led by the Taipei School of Economics and Political Science Foundation.

The exercises highlighted how much the defence of Taiwan hinges on **assumptions**. Such **unequivocal** US support is by no means guaranteed.

The current US administration is still projecting an image of the superpower protector, but the **volatility** of Trump and his team has sparked concern about its continuing support for Taiwan.

“But the lack of **coherence** and clarity in the Trump administration’s Taiwan policy has exacerbated scepticism toward Washington’s support for Taiwan since he won the election last November.”

An attempt to deflect a key decision by saying it was for a country’s president was **chided** by organisers.

“The exercise clearly showed limitations and some **malfunctions**.”

#### [2025-07-17 ‘Preparation is our only option’: sirens wail as Taiwan simulates China attack in city streets](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/17/taiwan-simulates-china-attack-city-streets-urban-warfare-annual-drill)

Usually people in Taipei walk quite slowly. **Notoriously** so.

Cars and buses pulled over in Ximen, and everyone was **ushered** into the nearby metro station.

The annual drills have become increasingly significant in recent years, as China’s leader, Xi Jinping, **forges ahead** with his plans to annex Taiwan as Chinese territory, by force if his current strategy of intimidation and coercion fails. 

This year the drill has been **incorporated** into much larger civilian urban resilience exercises, in partnership with local governments and private companies such as supermarket chains.

The exercises are normally **confined** to military bases, offshore islands, or **cordoned-off** beaches. But this year they have come much closer to the people, with urban warfare simulations in the city streets and on inter-county bridges, **repelling** assaults on airports and installing newly bought Himars multiple-launch rocket systems on the riverside bike path.

More than 20,000 **reservists** were involved in the force’s largest ever mobilisation.

It is thought the estimated 100,000 air raid shelters marked on public safety maps and apps include all known underground spaces such as car parks or **basements**.

It has labelled the drills “**futile**” provocations.

### Tariffs War

#### [2025-04-04 China hits back hard at ‘bullying’ Trump tariffs as global recession fears grow](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/china-donald-trump-tariffs-recession--us-stock-market)

The tariffs “clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of **sluggish** growth,” said the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva.

There was little sign of such moderation in China’s **trenchant** response to the Trump tariffs, however.

Still, in the UK, some economists suggested the tariffs may have only a **modest** impact. 

“And remember there are some decent **tailwinds** for growth this year, notably from government spending.”

#### [2025-04-08 Trump confirms 104% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of unfolding global trade war](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/trump-global-tariffs)

Donald Trump is poised to unleash his trade war with the world on Wednesday, pressing ahead with a **slew** of tariffs on the US’s largest trading partners despite fears of widespread economic damage and calls to reconsider.

The latest tariffs are higher than the 10% **flat rate** imposed on all global imports to the US on Friday last week.

But he again raised the prospect of agreements with countries on Tuesday, **trailing** a potential deal with South Korea.

In a **scathing** editorial, the official state news outlet Xinhua accused the US president of “**naked** **extortion**”.

#### [2025-05-12 Brazil’s president seeks ‘indestructible’ links with China amid Trump trade war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/brazil-china-trade-lula-da-silva-trump)

The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has **heralded** his desire to build “indestructible” relations with China, as the leaders of three of Latin America’s biggest economies flew to Beijing against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s trade war and the **profound** international uncertainty his presidency has generated.

Hours later Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, arrived, making a **beeline** for the Great Wall of China and declaring his desire for the South American country to not “only look one way” towards the US.

Addressing hundreds of Chinese and Brazilian business chiefs in the Chinese capital on Monday, Lula hit out at Trump’s tariffs, saying he could not accept the measures “that the president of the US tried to impose on planet Earth, **from one day to the next**”.

The Brazilian leftist said he hoped to build an “indispensable” relationship with China – already Brazil’s top trading partner – and **heaped** praise on his Communist party hosts as his officials announced $4.6bn (£3.5bn) of Chinese investment in their country.

The visit of the three South American leaders to China underlines the east Asian country’s rapidly growing **footprint** in a region where, over the past 25 years, it has become a **voracious** consumer of commodities such as soybeans, **iron ore** and copper.

The visits also come amid global **jitters** over Trump’s volatile presidency and Latin American anxiety and suspicion over the US president’s plans for a region where he has threatened to “take back” the Panama **canal** – by force if necessary.

“It tells us that countries around the world are willing to go out … to exploit all the opportunities that are there in the international system – and there are many. Because, as America turns away from free trade and as America adopts a policy that is … instead of **transactional**, **predatory** – countries have an incentive to engage with those who are transactional,” Spektor said, pointing to recent trips Lula made to Japan and Vietnam.

#### [2025-05-13 China cautiously welcomes pause in US tariff war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/13/china-cautiously-welcomes-pause-in-us-tariff-war)

After two days of talks between officials in Geneva over the weekend, China and the US agreed to **substantially** lower for the next 90 days the high tariffs each had imposed on the other in a tit-for-tat trade war.

Donald Trump hailed the talks as a “total reset” of the bilateral relationship but China’s responses made it clear that Beijing was still angry, and still blamed the US for **wreaking** economic chaos.

“While we are glad to see the resumption of dialogue, we are also fully prepared for the long-term, complex and **arduous** nature of resolving differences between the two countries,” it said.

On Monday, China’s commerce and finance ministries held discussions with foreign trade representatives about navigating the next three months and **weathering** the shocks of the tariffs.

“He can breathe, but he’s still far from being able to walk **briskly**,” they wrote.

#### [2025-05-22 World’s seven wealthiest countries agree to counter China’s trade practices](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/22/g7-china-trade)

Ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors there had been doubt about whether there would be a final **communique**, given divisions over US tariffs and Washington’s **reluctance** to refer to Russia’s war on Ukraine as illegal.

But after talks that stretched over three days, participants signed a lengthy document that was **devoid** of previous language on fighting climate change, left out their traditional defence of free trade and softened references to the Ukraine war.

“We found common ground on the most **pressing** global issues that we face.”

The **high-profile** gathering of officials from the US, Canada, the UK, Japan, Germany, France and Italy appeared to be more **congenial** than an earlier meeting of G7 foreign ministers in March. That meeting, also in Canada, occurred as Donald Trump was in the middle of threatening **stiff** tariffs on Canada and suggesting it could become the 51st state.

The description of the Ukraine war was **watered down** from the prior G7 statement issued in October, before Trump’s re-election, calling it an “illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine”.

Trump has diminished US support for Ukraine and has made statements suggesting that Kyiv was to blame for the conflict as he tries to **coax** Russia into peace talks.

#### [2025-05-24 As Trump focuses on his trade war, Brazil and China forge closer ties](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/24/as-trump-focuses-on-his-trade-war-brazil-and-china-forge-closer-ties)

Few world leaders can say they’ve been hugged by Xi Jinping, China’s typically **reserved** president.

Now Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, can count himself among the **hallowed** few to have broken the handshake barrier with Chinese leader. Stepping off the stage after giving a speech in Beijing earlier this month, Lula shook Xi’s hand, but the moment swiftly melted into something more **affectionate**.

In Lula’s address to the China-CELAC forum, a dialogue between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries, he condemned US tariffs and said the Latin American region wanted to be “the axis of a multipolar order where the Global South is **duly** represented.”

Lula’s presence at the forum was itself a **coup** for China as it seeks to expand its global influence in Latin America. Lula in particular got a full bells-and-whistles welcome to Beijing, with a military performance in Tiananmen Square including a 21 gun **salute**.

But while Trump’s vision for the global order is still coming into focus, Beijing has for years **trumpeted** the importance of a “multipolar” system of international cooperation. It is a sentiment that Lula echoes.

#### [2025-06-05 Donald Trump to meet Xi Jinping in China after ‘very good’ call on trade](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/donald-trump-xi-jinping-china-phone-call-invitation-trade-tariffs)

He wrote: “During the conversation, President Xi **graciously** invited the First Lady and me to visit China, and I reciprocated.”

#### [2025-06-11 US and China agree framework deal to extend trade war truce](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/11/us-china-trade-talks-framework-deal-amid-dispute-over-rare-earths)

Its implementation had **faltered** over China’s curbs on critical mineral exports.

#### [2025-07-07 Is Trump tariff deal really a win for Vietnam – or a way of punishing China?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/vietnam-trump-tariff-deal)

However, a 40% tariff will remain for so-called transshipments – a **provision** that is aimed at Chinese companies accused of passing their products through Vietnam, or elsewhere, to avoid US tariffs.

However, this caused the Vietnamese trade surplus with the US to surge, attracting US **ire** and allegations that Vietnam was wrongly acting as a **conduit** for Chinese companies wanting access to the US market.

Vietnam’s manufacturing industry is closely **intertwined** with both the US and China. US exports account for 30% of Vietnam’s GDP, while China is Vietnam’s top import source, relied on for raw materials used to make anything from **footwear** to furniture and electronics.

“China is completely **interwoven** into global supply chains,” says Dan Martin.

It considers the US not only a key export market but a security partner that serves as a counterbalance to China’s **assertiveness**.

However, if Beijing considers that Hanoi is helping Washington constrain it, this risks **antagonising** Vietnam’s northern neighbour.

However the market for cars remains small in Vietnam, where city streets are famously **crammed** with millions of motorbikes.

In their sights are Chinese officials and workers, who the US intelligence agency hopes to turn against Beijing via some newly released **glossy** videos.

“The information you can provide is important and we value your **insights** on these topics.”

The agency has said it has had previous success **enlisting** Russians.

“Our agency must continue responding to this threat with urgency, creativity, and **grit**, and these videos are just one of the ways we are doing this.”

#### [2025-05-24 ‘Alarming’ rise in regional internet censorship in China, study finds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/24/alarming-rise-in-regional-internet-censorship-in-china-study-finds)

China’s authorities appear to have implemented an enhanced version of the country’s internet censorship **regime** in the central province of Henan.

Five officials were later punished for abusing the health code system to **quell** the protests.

The emergence of a regional censorship regime in Henan is unusual because it is not a region of China that is normally considered especially **restive** by the Chinese authorities.

Rapid advances in China’s artificial intelligence companies are a **boon** to both the censors and those who wish to **evade** them.

For example, AI can assist in developing more **agile** testing tools for detecting censorship.”

#### [2025-05-27 Poorest 75 nations face ‘tidal wave’ of debt repayments to China in 2025, study warns](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/27/poorest-750-nations-face-tidal-wave-of-debt-repayments-to-china-in-2025-study-warns)

The most vulnerable nations on Earth are facing a “tidal wave” of debt repayments as a Chinese **lending boom** starts to be called in, a new report has warned.

The pressure to repay was putting strain on local funding for health and education as well as climate change **mitigation**.

The loans were largely issued under President Xi Jinping’s signature belt and road initiative (BRI), a state-backed global infrastructure investment programme which has **underwritten** national projects from schools, bridges and hospitals to major roads and shipping and air ports.

The lending **spree** turned China into the largest supplier of bilateral loans, peaking with a total of more than $50bn in 2016 – more than all western creditors combined.

But the practice has raised concerns about Chinese influence and control and drawn accusations that Beijing was seeking to **entrap** recipient nations with unserviceable debt.

China’s government denies accusations it deliberately creates debt traps, and recipient nations have also **pushed back**, saying China was a more reliable partner and offered crucial loans when others refused.

But the situation also put China in a **bind**, pulled between diplomatic pressure to **restructure** unsustainable debt in vulnerable nations and domestic pressure to **recall** loans amid China’s own economic downturn.

In Jiangxi province, for example, footage will be reviewed after the exam and any violations or **misconduct** “dealt with strictly in accordance with relevant regulations”, the state-backed Global Times reports.

Late last month, Chinese authorities also announced stricter entry checks at exam points, **biometric** identification, enhanced screening for digital devices, and radio signal blockers, state media reported.

Reflecting how seriously Chinese society views the gaokao, some cities have postponed disruptive events such as public performances, delayed office starting hours and created **dedicated** priority traffic lanes to ensure students arrive to the test on time.

He was suspended last year and placed under investigation for “serious violations of discipline”, a **byword** for corruption.

Miao’s dismissal reflects the latest **ructions** in China’s armed forces.

Since then, millions of officials have been investigated, and hundreds of thousands reportedly penalised, including high-profile people being expelled or **prosecuted**.

Speculation that he was under investigation ran **rampant** until October when Beijing announced he had been removed from his post.

#### [2025-07-04 Hong Kong code of conduct will oblige legislators to ‘sincerely support’ Beijing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/04/hong-kong-code-of-conduct-sincerely-support-beijing)

A new **code** of conduct in Hong Kong will require legislators to “sincerely support” Beijing’s jurisdiction on the city and the chief executive, and prohibits anything that might “**vilify**” the government.

It **stipulated** that legislators must “sincerely support the central government’s overall jurisdiction while securing the Hong Kong SAR’s special administrative region’s high degree of autonomy”, as well as the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong”, referring to election reforms which ensure that only pro-Beijing candidates can run.

Hong Kong’s governance system has undergone major **overhauls** in recent years, after a crackdown on the city’s pro-democracy movement and politicians saw major interventions by the government in Beijing.

A separate proposal this week flags new prison rules which include only allowing visits pre-approved by the correctional services department, would empower the department to consider restrictions on **clergy** visits, and seek rulings to bar visits by specific legal representatives to imprisoned clients.

“In fact, they are using soft means to influence prisoners, intending to incite them to resist the supervision of the correctional services department, **arouse** their hatred towards the central government and the SAR government, and even make them become potential risks to national security and public safety after returning to society.”

#### [2025-07-07 China’s human rights lawyers speak out, 10 years after crackdown](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/chinas-human-rights-lawyers-speak-out-10-years-after-crackdown)

The environment for human rights law has “steadily **regressed**, especially after the pandemic”, said Ren Quanniu, a **disbarred** human rights lawyer. During that time judicial organs were attacked as “**bourgeois**” and the **nascent** court system was largely suspended.

According to human rights groups and the US government, about 300 people from the loose collective of a **burgeoning** rights defence movement, known as weiquan, were targeted in the round-up. At least 10 were convicted of crimes such as “subversion of state power” and given jail terms, while dozens more have been subjected to **surveillance**, harassment and the revocation of their professional licences in the years since.

Lawyers scored wins for defendants in cases ranging from **tainted** baby milk formula scandals to the abuse of migrant workers.

The daily grind was not about **promulgating** foreign ideas, said Ren.

Under Xi’s rule, activists have been rounded up, independent law firms and NGOs have been **reined** in, and any kind of organised activity outside the **auspices** of the Communist party (CCP) has been tightly restricted.

“The Chinese government under Xi Jinping has sought to **eradicate** the influence of lawyers who defend people’s rights,” said Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch.

Ren escaped the first wave of **reprisals** after the 709 incident.

“Although the year of the 709 incident marked a major regression in the rule of law in China … people, I believe, are gradually building resilience, **maturing** and becoming stronger.”

Wells Fargo has since banned all employees from travelling to China since Mao – a **naturalised** US citizen of **Chinese descent** – was stopped from leaving.

A 2023 report by Safeguard Defenders said that since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, “China has expanded the **legal landscape** for exit bans and increasingly used them, sometimes outside legal justification”.

Cynthia and Victor Liu were subject to an exit ban, despite not facing any criminal allegations. Their father, a former bank official and **fugitive** Liu Changming, was wanted in China to face fraud charges.

The latest confrontation appears to have emerged on Thursday, when Chinese state media reported the Coast Guard landed on the disputed reef two weeks ago, **unfurled** a flag and “exercised sovereign jurisdiction”.

“The facts on the ground **belie** their statements,” National Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said.

The group also “cleaned up **leftover** plastic bottles, wooden sticks and other debris and garbage on the reef”, the broadcaster reported.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday morning, Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, rejected the **premise** of China’s criticism of Hegseth.

Past years have often seen the US and China trade **barbs**, but also occasionally hold significant meetings, including last year with China’s defence minister, Dong Jun, and Hegseth’s predecessor, Lloyd Austin.

Referencing China’s absence, Chan said Beijing should use “every opportunity” available to **get** its position **across**.

“But regardless of whether China attends the dialogue, it is **incumbent** on all of us to reach out to China in different forums … to not end up in a situation where either side misinterprets, miscalculates, or misrepresents each other’s position. That is dangerous.”

The countries are **embroiled** in a longstanding territorial dispute over the Senkakus – uninhabited islets in the east China Sea that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, where they are known as the Diaoyu.

Minamitori, the easternmost point of the Japanese **archipelago**, is surrounded by large deposits of rare metals.

Wind power installations reached 26 GW, the equivalent of about 5,300 **turbines**.

Trump withdrew from many major environmental protection treaties, such as the Paris climate agreement which aims to limit global warming to well below two degrees **celsius** above preindustrial levels.

China holds major reserves of several key minerals including the vast majority of the world’s **graphite**, which is crucial for electric vehicles.

In a joint statement, the Quad countries said: “Reliance on any one country for processing and refining critical minerals and **derivative** goods production exposes our industries to economic coercion, price manipulation and supply chain disruptions.”

At Jaishankar’s urging, the Quad also condemned a May attack on the Indian side of Kashmir that killed mostly Hindu civilians and called for “the **perpetrators**, organisers and financiers of this **reprehensible** act to be brought to justice without any delay”.

India has maintained its long relationship with Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine, while both India and Japan also have historically enjoyed **cordial** ties with Iran.

Few **break-ups** have as many gossiping observers as the fallout between the once inseparable Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

The ill-fated bromance between the US president and the world’s richest man, which once raised questions about American **oligarchy**, is now being **pored** over by social media users in China, many of whom are Team Musk.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is widely **venerated** in China for his business **acumen** and technological achievements.

The conversation has been allowed to **flourish** on China’s tightly controlled social media, suggesting that at least some censors are betting that the US political chaos could be no bad thing for China.

In a video message played on Wednesday during prayer celebrations ahead of his 90th birthday this weekend, the 14th Dalai Lama said the Gaden Phodrang Trust, which manages his affairs, would oversee the search for his **reincarnation**.

It has said the choice of the next Dalai Lama lies only with Beijing, and has enshrined state **assent** for all senior Tibetan religious leaders in law. It insists the golden urn – a Qing dynasty **ritual** in which names are drawn by lot from a ceremonial vessel – is the only legitimate method for recognising reincarnated lamas.

Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama is the **earthly** manifestation of Avalokiteshvara, a **revered** figure in Buddhism known as the bodhisattva of compassion – a spiritual being who remains in the world to guide others on the path to **enlightenment**.

By tradition, only the current Dalai Lama, or those he appoints, can identify his successor, using visions, **omens** and consultation with senior lamas and protectors of the faith.

Modi’s **effusive** support is significant.

“We support efforts to preserve Tibetans’ distinct **linguistic**, cultural and religious heritage, including their ability to freely choose and venerate religious leaders without interference,” the statement added.

Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te – who leads an island that China says is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to seize – said in a statement read at the ceremony that the example set by the Dalai Lama “resonates with all who **cherish** freedom, democracy and respect for human rights”.

“At a time when we see the forces of division tearing at the **fabric** of our common humanity … I’m grateful for your enduring efforts to build a better, kinder, more compassionate world,” Bill Clinton said.

The country of about 17,000 people has seen ties with its biggest ally and former colonial partner New Zealand **fray** as leaders draw it closer to Beijing.

“We don’t want a Cook Islands passport, that’s a bloody **dead-end** passport.”

“New Zealand has been increasingly clear over the years that, particularly in the security **realm**, that it sees China as a disruptor and a destabilising actor in the Pacific.”

As preparations for a massive inter-island celebration unfold, the event is **tinged** with diplomatic unease.

#### [2025-07-17 Restaurant in China criticised for putting baby lion cuddles on menu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/17/restaurant-china-baby-lion-cuddles-menu)

A restaurant in northern China has been criticised by animal **welfare** groups for offering an unusual item on the menu: lion **cub** **cuddles**.

The restaurant’s profile on Dazhong Dianping, a popular restaurant listings app, shows pictures of the lion cubs alongside other animals, such as deer and **alligators**.

The menu on the Dianping page does not include lions in its list of animals but says customers can play with **llamas**, turtles and **meerkats**.

Several photos show customers **snuggling** the baby lions.

Peter Li, a China policy expert for Humane World for Animals, told Reuters: “Exploiting wild animals for **selfies** and marketing **gimmicks** is not only **appallingly** bad animal welfare, it’s also potentially risky for customers.”

It is not the first **exotic** animal welfare scandal in China. Last month, tourists visiting a zoo in Liaoning, in the north-east, were condemned for reaching through a metal grate to pull tufts of hair off a tiger.

Contact between humans and exotic animals has also been highlighted by experts as a potential risk for the spread of **zoonotic** diseases, such as Covid-19.

In comparison, the Three **Gorges** dam cost 254.2bn yuan and generates 88.2m MWh.

The Yarlung Tsangpo megadam will reportedly **harness** the power created by the river dropping 2km in about 50km as it winds through a **canyon** on a U-shaped bend.

Last year hundreds of people were arrested while protesting against the Kamtok dam on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river, which they said threatened to displace thousands of residents and submerge ancient Buddhist **monasteries**.

Environmentalists have also expressed concern about wildlife in the region, as well as the significant **tectonic** shifting, severe landslides and extreme geography where the dam is expected to go.

An investigative report released by the Gansu provincial party committee on Sunday found a **litany** of failures in safety and oversight, as well as attempts to cover up the incident, bribe people in charge and modify test results.

The report said the **principal** at the Tianshui kindergarten had wanted to attract more **enrolments** by “enhancing” the colour and look of the food served to children. The school’s cook bought industrial-grade **pigment** online, adding it to dishes despite the packages saying it was “not for consumption”.

Local state media quoted a parent at the time saying children had suffered stomach pain and **nausea**, and some children’s teeth had turned black.

It said the Gansu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention **neglected** the case after accepting it, and took samples in a way that violated health regulations and led to a “huge difference” in the test results and the actual levels.

It said the children had been treated and all but one had been **discharged** after the first round of treatment, during which lead levels dropped by an average of 40%.
