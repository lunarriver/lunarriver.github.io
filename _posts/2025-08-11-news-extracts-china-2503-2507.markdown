#### [2024-04-01 China launches surprise military drills around Taiwan | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/china-launches-surprise-military-drills-around-taiwan)

The publicity around the exercise likely also **has** the US **in mind** – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker and to deter the US from maintaining high levels of support to Taiwan.”

#### [2025-04-02 China military drills targeting Taiwan put region’s security at risk, says US | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/us-says-china-military-drills-targeting-taiwan-put-regions-security-at-risk)

The US has accused China of putting the region’s security at risk after it launched a second day of military drills targeting Taiwan with a **rehearsal** blockade and attack.

“Once again, China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to **exacerbate** tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk,” it said.

On Wednesday a second one was released titled “**paralysis**”.

#### [2025-04-23 Taiwan president will not attend Pope Francis’s funeral](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/taiwan-president-will-not-attend-pope-francis-funeral)

Taiwan’s deputy foreign minister, Wu Chih-chung, had earlier said the government was in talks with the Vatican over Lai’s **attendance**.

Wu was speaking outside Taipei’s **Catholic** **Archdiocese**, where he was accompanying Lai on a visit to pay respects to Francis. Lai did not speak to the press.

China’s relations with the Vatican appeared to improve under Francis, who oversaw controversial agreements with Beijing about the appointments of Catholic **bishops** in China.

Guo was asked about Pope Francis’s repeated wishes that he could visit China and meet leaders, and whether breaking ties with Taiwan was a **prerequisite** for this to ever happen with a future **pontiff**.

#### [2025-04-27 Taiwan cracks down on holders of Chinese ID amid fears over propaganda and espionage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/taiwan-chinese-passport-id-card-crackdown)

================================================================================================================================================

Taiwan has launched a crackdown on holders of illegal Chinese identity documents, **revoking** the Taiwanese **status** of more than 20 people and putting tens of thousands of Chinese-born residents under scrutiny.

In the past decade, hundreds of people have had their Taiwanese **papers** or passports cancelled for also holding Chinese ID, effectively revoking their **citizenship**.

The campaign has sparked a nationwide **debate** about identity, loyalty and how to balance the island’s **treasured** political freedoms with its national security.

The current **furore** began in December, with an online **documentary** revealing local Chinese authorities were secretly offering Chinese IDs to Taiwanese people.

The documentary identified three **recipients** who had moved to the Chinese province of Fujian and applied for Chinese identity cards.

Su Shih-er was one of the three. He chose the **coastal province** for its large Taiwanese community and generous government **subsidies** for **entrepreneurs** opening “local” businesses.

In March Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, announced new measures to counter China’s **malign** efforts, which included increased scrutiny of cross-strait travel and **resettlement**.

In March, three Chinese-born women were accused of using their popular social media accounts to advocate for a **hostile** Chinese **takeover** of Taiwan.

The opposition accused the government of deporting people without **due process** for views it didn’t like.

But government figures said the posts were **essentially** enemy war propaganda, exempt from free-speech protection.

The case highlighted “the unique **dilemma** of Taiwan’s existence”, wrote two local academics, Michelle Kuo and Albert Wu.

But, they added: “Taiwan is under **exceptional** threat. Can we apply human rights principles around family unity and freedom of speech when facing such a massive danger?”

In March the MAC sent **questionnaires** to public sector workers, university employees and military personnel, asking them if they ever held Chinese ID.

Then, earlier this month, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) began contacting more than 10,000 Chinese-born **spouses** in Taiwan, claiming they had never provided proof they had given up their Chinese hukuo – a requirement for permanent residency.

**Rescinding** hukou can only be done in person, in China. Some commenters pointed to the case of Li Yanhe, a Chinese-born, Taiwan-based publisher of critical books about the CCP. In 2023 Li was arrested in Shanghai, reportedly there to rescind his hukou. Convicted of unspecified acts of “**inciting** **secession**”, he remains in a Chinese jail.

The MAC deputy head, Liang Wen-chieh, said last week they were demonstrating “utmost **leniency** towards such individuals”. But amid an **outcry** the government announced **case-by-case** exemptions, including for people who are elderly, haven’t returned to China in more than 10 years, or feared **persecution** if they did.

During the furore over the deported influencers, academics Kuo and Wu warned that the government “may have **inadvertently** handed Beijing an easy propaganda victory”.

The Guardian’s conversations with people in or close to the government have revealed a **perplexity** over the **backlash**, and a belief that any concerns are **outweighed** by the need to address any vulnerability China could exploit.

“More than 360,000 Chinese spouses live in Taiwan today,” Kuo and Wu wrote in their essay. “While they may appear to be a demographic minority, their family networks make up a significant portion of society – one the government now risks **alienating**.”

#### [2025-05-08 Taiwan president says country faces similar threat to Europe before WW2](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/taiwan-president-europe-second-world-war)

Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has compared his nation to the European countries **heading for** conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, in a **punchy** speech commemorating the end of the second world war in Europe.

“Eighty years after the end of the European war, the **message** of history is clear. Today, 80 years later, we **share** the same values ​​and face similar challenges as many of the democracies that participated in the European war,” Lai said to a group of foreign **dignitaries** gathered in Taipei.

The conflict is a **thorny** topic in cross-strait relations. China at the time was ruled by the Kuomintang, or the nationalists, under the **banner** of the Republic of China. During the war, the Kuomintang fought alongside the Chinese Communist party (CCP) against the Japanese, before resuming their own civil conflict, which led to the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 and establishing the Republic of China there. This remains the island’s official name. The CCP established the People’s Republic of China in Beijing.

In a **veiled reference** to China, Lai called on “freedom-loving people and countries” to work together to counter authoritarian regimes.

“Taiwan and Europe are jointly facing the threat of a new **totalitarian** group,” Lai said. “The bitter experience of world war two tells us that **appeasement** will only make the invaders more greedy and expand their ambitions.”

Thursday’s event opened with a short video **featuring** clips of the D-day landings in Normandy and audio recordings of Winston Churchill’s famous “We shall fight on the beaches” speech. The top British representative in Taiwan, Ruth Bradley-Jones, spoke at the event, as did Lutz Güllner, the head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan

Marcin Jerzewski, the head of the Taiwan office of the European Values Center for Security Policy, said Lai was “trying to send the message that security and prosperity of Taiwan and Europe are still **interconnected**, so that European partners fearing possible withdrawal of American security guarantees from Europe don’t turn away from their engagements with the Indo-Pacific and security in the Taiwan Strait.”

Lai is **steering** Taiwan through a fraught geopolitical moment. The self-governing island is claimed by China, which has vowed to annex it with the use of force if necessary. Since Donald Trump took office as US president in January, the commitment of the US, Taiwan’s main security backer, to helping Taiwan defend itself has been unclear.

China frequently **rehearses** blockades of Taiwan. So-called “greyzone” tactics such as disinformation campaigns have been increasing.

Wen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said Lai also wanted to show that “Taiwan wants to be a partner, not just a recipient, of western **largesse**”.

In an article published in Russian media on Wednesday about Chinese and Soviet cooperation during the second world war, Xi **devoted** a **lengthy** section to the war’s **implications** for China’s claims on Taiwan.

#### [2025-05-12 Taiwan ex-president Tsai Ing-wen to visit UK as China ratchets up threats against Taipei](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/tsai-ing-wen-uk-visit-former-taiwan-president)

Tsai was invited by “friends in Britain’s parliament” in a trip that is designed to deepen friendship between Taiwan and Britain, the office said in a statement, adding Tsai, who has a **doctorate** from the London School of Economics, will meet unspecified British politicians.

Tsai had been due to visit London in October last year, but that coincided with a trip to Beijing by British foreign secretary David Lammy at a time when London was trying to reset **strained** ties with China. Tsai did not **end up going**.

Tsai last year visited the **Czech** Republic, France, **Belgium** and Canada, drawing condemnation from Beijing which has repeatedly **denounced** Tsai as a “separatist”.

China says Taiwan is one of its provinces with no right to the **trappings** of a state, a position Taipei’s government strongly rejects.

#### [2025-05-20 Taiwan president calls for peace and dialogue with China amid heightened military activity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/20/taiwan-president-calls-for-peace-and-dialogue-with-china-amid-heightened-military-activity)

Taiwan’s president has reiterated calls for peace and dialogue with China as he marked one year in office, amid heightened Chinese military activity and **worsening** political division at home.

Lai Ching-te, who was inaugurated a year ago, told reporters on Tuesday that a war would have “no winners”, but Taiwan would continue to strengthen its defences to **ward off** a Chinese invasion or attempt to annex it by force.

“It is the aggressor who undermines peace … Taiwan is a peace-loving nation, and our society values **goodwill**,” he said on Tuesday in response to questions after his formal address. “I am deeply committed to peace, because peace is priceless, and in war there are no winners.”

“However, **whilst** our pursuit of peace is sincere, it must not be naive.”

He urged Beijing to restart dialogue with his government on equal terms, “using exchanges to replace **hemming in**, dialogue to replace confrontation”.

“Since taking office, the Lai Ching-te administration has **brazenly** pursued ‘Taiwan independence’ to **serve** partisan and personal gain, charging **headlong** down a path of division and confrontation that threatens the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,” it said.

Taiwan authorities had publicly warned of likely Chinese retaliation or pre-emptive activity in response to the speech. Last week government officials told reporters they couldn’t rule out military drills in the days after Lai spoke, and on Monday the coast guard said Beijing could launch “political warfare” to disrupt public **morale** in Taiwan.

“The trade de-escalation reached between Beijing and Washington has generated anxiety in Taipei over whether the issue of Taiwan may emerge in future US-China talks,” said Amanda Hsiao, a director in Eurasia Group’s China practice, referring to fears Beijing may seek a **softening** of the US’s longstanding support of Taiwan.

The KMT and another rival party, the TPP, control the majority of seats in Taiwan’s **legislature** and have been accused of blocking Lai’s agenda.

The opposition parties have accused Lai and his Democratic Progressive party of increasing tensions with China and **stifling** opposition.

#### [2025-06-04 World won’t forget Tiananmen Square, US and Taiwan say on 36th anniversary of massacre](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/04/world-wont-forget-tiananmen-square-us-and-taiwan-say-on-36th-anniversary-of-massacre)

“Today we commemorate the **bravery** of the Chinese people who were killed as they tried to exercise their fundamental freedoms, as well as those who continue to suffer persecution as they seek accountability and justice for the events of June 4, 1989,” said Marco Rubio, the US’s top diplomat, in a statement.

The date of 4 June remains one of China’s strictest **taboos**, and the Chinese government employs extensive and increasingly sophisticated resources to censor any discussion or acknowledgment of it inside China. Internet censors scrub even the most obscure references to the date from online spaces, and activists in China are often put under increased surveillance or sent on enforced “holidays” away from Beijing.

New research from human rights workers has found that the sensitive date also sees heightened **transnational** **repression** of Chinese government critics overseas by the government and its proxies.

The report published on Wednesday by Article 19, a human rights research and **advocacy** group, said that the Chinese government “has engaged in a systematic international campaign of transnational repression targeting protesters critical of the Chinese Communist party,” with Uyghurs, Tibetans and Hongkongers particularly likely to be affected.

“Protesters targeted by transnational repression frequently live in fear of surveillance; targeting; abduction and forced **repatriation**, especially around embassies and consulates; and ‘collective punishment’ retaliation against relatives still in China, which also leads people to cut ties with their family,” the report said.

The Article 19 researchers found that, with Tiananmen Square **vigils** **snuffed** out in China, pro-CCP agents appear to be targeting commemorations in other parts of the world.

In 2022, a **replica** of a statue known as the “Pillar of Shame”, by Danish artist Jens Galschiøt, was **vandalised** in Taipei. The statue is designed to memorialise the people who died on 4 June 1989. The original was on display at the University of Hong Kong for 23 years before it was removed by university authorities in 2021.

But since the 2019 pro-democracy protests and the **ensuing** crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, the annual 4 June vigil in Victoria Park has been banned. In recent years some high profile activists have been **prosecuted** over attempts to mark the day. For the last three years a government-sponsored food **carnival** has been held on the site during the week of the anniversary.

A performance artist, Chan Mei-tung, was stopped and searched, and later **escorted** from the area by police. She was standing on the road chewing gum, according to the outlet.

A key criticism of Hong Kong’s national security laws are that they are broad and the **proscribed** crimes are ill-defined.

One of the few groups of people in China who are still outspoken about the events of 36 years ago are the rapidly ageing “Tiananmen Mothers”, parents of young people killed in the massacre, who have called for an official **reckoning**.

Li said he was **compelled** to talk “as a warning to the world”, and also to Taiwan which is facing the threat of Chinese annexation.

They work to crush all **instability** at the earliest stage,” he said according to CNA’s translation.

#### [2025-06-06 Frequent TikTok users in Taiwan more likely to agree with pro-China narratives, study finds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/frequent-tiktok-users-in-taiwan-more-likely-to-agree-with-pro-china-narratives-study-finds)

Social media is a key **battleground** in China’s information warfare, as it seeks to convince or coerce Taiwan into accepting annexation without military conflict.

The DoubleThink Lab report claimed the more active TikTok users showed stronger **correlations** with an openness to Chinese propaganda and the idea that unification with China is inevitable and democracy should be sacrificed for peace.

There was also correlation with unhappiness about current domestic issues, including opposition-driven accusations of **judicial** unfairness and **erosions** of free speech.

“Our analysis suggests that active TikTok use is more likely to influence users’ political attitudes toward being more anti-democratic **establishment** and positive attitudes toward PRC governance, even among groups traditionally opposed to the CCP,” said the report’s author, Eric Hsu.

TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and fears of it being used to spread pro-CCP propaganda have already resulted in restrictions or threats of **outright** bans in several countries, including the US. In Taiwan, there are rules against TikTok being used on government devices.

In 2019, the Guardian revealed how ByteDance used TikTok to **advance** Beijing’s foreign policy aims by moderating sensitive content.

Tai said Taiwan was on the frontline of China’s propaganda efforts, and its digital environment was “complex”. She added: “TikTok is not the only app young people use”, noting that Douyin – the Chinese domestic version of TikTok, which some Taiwanese also use – is very different in content and **moderation** to TikTok.

He said it could not be ruled out that users were just more **inclined** to agree with such views and so were being fed content that aligned with their interests.

#### [2025-06-11 Four former staff of Taiwan’s ruling party charged with spying for China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/11/four-former-officials-in-taiwans-ruling-party-charged-with-spying-for-china-ntwnfb)

They had been accused of sharing state secrets with China over a **prolonged** period of time, including “important and sensitive diplomatic information” that significantly harmed national security, prosecutors alleged in a statement. One of the accused, who worked for a Taipei city **councillor**, is accused of transmitting information to China “via a specific messaging app”. Other alleged **offences** include money laundering.

Prosecutors are seeking prison sentences ranging from five to more than 18 years, and the **confiscation** of more than NT$8.3m (£205,000/US$277,000) in illicit gains.

Two **defendants** confessed but two others, including the former Wu staffer, had denied the allegations against them, prosecutors said.

Taiwan has ramped up its efforts to **root out** Taiwanese spies working for the Chinese government.

Taiwan and China have spied on each other for decades, but analysts say Taiwan is under greater threat **given** Beijing’s annexation intentions. Chinese authorities in May announced small **bounties** for information leading to the capture of 20 Taiwanese nationals they accused of hacking into a Guangzhou tech company, an accusation Taiwan dismissed as false.

#### [2025-06-11 Hong Kong police tell people not to download ‘secessionist’ mobile game](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/11/hong-kong-police-taiwan-mobile-games-reversed-front)

Hong Kong police have warned people against downloading a Taiwan-developed mobile game which they say is “**secessionist**” and could lead to arrest.

The game, Reversed Front: Bonfire, allows users to “pledge **allegiance**” to various groups linked to locations that have been major flashpoints or targets for China including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, Uyghurs, Kazakhs and Manchuria, in order to “overthrow the communist regime” known as the “People’s Republic”.

While some aspects and place names of the game’s worldview are imagined, the website says the game is “a work of NON-**FICTION**” and “any similarity to actual agencies, policies, or ethnic groups of the PRC China in this game is **INTENTIONAL**”.

Downloading the game could lead to players being charged with possessing **seditious** material, while making in-app purchases could be viewed as providing funding to the developers “for the commission of secession or subversion”, the police said.

Recommending the game could also **constitute** the offence of “incitement to secession”.

In Reversed Front’s worldview, communists have conquered surrounding lands and formed a mega state, ruling it as a “colonial power with unprecedented **cruelty**”, and forcing many of the conquered peoples to flee. Decades later, only Taiwan still stands its ground, “**fending** off the persistent **aggravation**”.

The game asks players if Taiwan can stay safe by avoiding provocative action, or if it should “refrain from repeating the same mistakes of the last 30 years which allowed the communists to grow into the **behemoth** today”.

In player descriptions, the game describes the communists as “heavy-handed, reckless and **inept**” and accused of “widespread corruption, **embezzlement**, **exploitation**, **slaughter** and **defilement**”.

The developers vowed not to actively filter or review any words or phrases in the game – a **nod** to recent controversies over censorship in Chinese-made or China-related games. It is unclear where ESC Taiwan is based.

The police warning over the game forms part of an ongoing crackdown on pro-democracy opposition in Hong Kong, where CCP control has steadily tightened around the once semi-autonomous city. In 2020 Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong, with the city government’s **blessing**, **outlawing** a broad range of dissenting behaviours as criminal.

#### [2025-06-18 Malfunctions, overreactions and a steep learning curve: wargaming a Chinese attack on Taiwan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/taiwan-war-games-china-attack)

Last week former senior military and government officials from the US, Japan, and Taiwan convened in Taipei for a **tabletop** exercise, led by the Taipei School of Economics and Political Science Foundation. The event was described as the first civilian-led military simulation held in Taiwan, testing responses to a **hypothetical** attempt by China to annex the territory.

Three teams were presented with scenarios set in 2030 but based on China’s current strategies and their expected military advancements. A fourth team represented China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), while a control group of the games’ organisers drove proceedings and ran **feedback sessions**.

The exercises highlighted how much the defence of Taiwan **hinges** on **assumptions**, with for example, the US team quickly offering military defence to Taiwan before the scenarios escalated into a fully **fledged** war. Such **unequivocal** US support is by no means guaranteed.

The US refuses to confirm if it will defend Taiwan militarily, under a decades-old doctrine of “strategic **ambiguity**” designed to discourage either side from making provocative moves. Joe Biden signalled that – under his presidency at least – the US military would probably back Taiwan against a Chinese invasion.

The current US administration is still projecting an image of the superpower protector, but the **volatility** of Trump and his team has sparked concern about its continuing support for Taiwan.

“The view from the US is that this part of the world, and this relationship is on a **hair trigger**, and the worry is that any incident of some significance could cause very rapid escalation,” said a US team member.

“The red line for Washington, based on the outcome of the exercise, seems to be Beijing’s **initiation** of a blockade,” said William Yang, a senior north-east Asia analyst for the International Crisis Group who witnessed the two days of games.

“But the lack of **coherence** and clarity in the Trump administration’s Taiwan policy has exacerbated scepticism toward Washington’s support for Taiwan since he won the election last November.”

The games raised other vulnerabilities, particularly among the Taiwanese strategists, who were initially overcautious and then overreacted, according to the assessment of control group **supervisors**.

An early decision by the Taiwan team, to not respond to a PLA incursion inside the island’s 12-nautical mile marine border, was **ridiculed** by local media, and an attempt to deflect a key decision by saying it was for a country’s president was **chided** by organisers.

Japan’s team also expressed concern about minimal communication from Taiwan, saying the team did not **adequately** convey what it wanted from Japan during scenarios.

“The tabletop exercise seemed quite realistic, especially in regards to Taiwan’s communication,” said participant Takei Tomohisa, a former chief of staff of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defence Force. “The exercise clearly showed limitations and some **malfunctions**.”

#### [2025-07-17 ‘Preparation is our only option’: sirens wail as Taiwan simulates China attack in city streets](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/17/taiwan-simulates-china-attack-city-streets-urban-warfare-annual-drill)

Usually people in Taipei walk quite slowly. **Notoriously** so. But at 1.27pm on Thursday some were almost sprinting through the busy shopping district of Ximen.

Cars and buses **pulled over** in Ximen, and everyone was **ushered** into the nearby metro station. Mr Liu, 70, was not quite fast enough to get to his meeting and was **pacing** the station entrance looking at his watch.

**Nevertheless** he said he supported the drills because they helped people “feel safe” and taught them what to do if one day the real thing – a Chinese airstrike – hits the city.

The annual drills have become increasingly significant in recent years, as China’s leader, Xi Jinping, **forges ahead** with his plans to annex Taiwan as Chinese territory, by force if his current strategy of intimidation and coercion fails. The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East also make the drills feel less **hypothetical**.

This year the drill has been **incorporated** into much larger civilian urban resilience exercises, in partnership with local governments and private companies such as supermarket chains. They are also being held **concurrently** with Han Kuang, Taiwan’s annual military exercises, which themselves have doubled in length and **ballooned** in size.

The exercises – a key demonstration of Taiwan’s defensive preparations against the threat of Chinese invasion – are normally **confined** to military bases, offshore islands, or **cordoned-off** beaches. But this year they have come much closer to the people, with urban warfare simulations in the city streets and on inter-county bridges, **repelling** assaults on airports and installing newly bought Himars multiple-launch rocket systems on the riverside bike path.

More than 20,000 **reservists** were involved in the force’s largest ever mobilisation, and about 52,000 of a planned 4 million people had been trained as disaster relief volunteers, the deputy interior minister, Maa Shyh-yuan, said this week. There are also proposed budget measures to better resource local village authorities.

Since taking office in May last year, Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has continued his predecessor’s boosting of the armed forces, **sharpened** laws and language against Chinese aggression, and **prioritised** civilian defence and resilience.

The increased **incorporation** of civilians has been welcomed by some non-government groups that have been lobbying for it for years.

There are still some concerns. It is thought the estimated 100,000 air raid shelters marked on public safety maps and apps include all known underground spaces such as car parks or **basements**, which do not necessarily have **adequate** **ventilation** or power supply.

China’s ruling Communist party is obviously watching. It has labelled the drills “**futile**” provocations, and has increased the already **elevated** number of warplane and ship incursions into Taiwan’s air defence zone.

### Tariffs War

#### [2025-04-04 China hits back hard at ‘bullying’ Trump tariffs as global recession fears grow](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/china-donald-trump-tariffs-recession--us-stock-market)

China has hit back hard against Donald Trump’s “bullying” tariffs, raising fears that the escalating trade war could trigger a global **recession** and prompting fresh turmoil in financial markets.

The tariffs “clearly represent a significant risk to the global **outlook** at a time of **sluggish** growth,” said the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva.

The UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said ministers would continue to negotiate with Washington, in the hope that the 10% levy on UK exports could be **lifted**.

“I would have thought the central expectation now must be that if she is **sticking to** her fiscal rules, she’ll need to increase taxes in the autumn by possibly some significant amount,” said Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
On Wall Street, the tech-focused Nasdaq index entered bear market territory – meaning it has lost more than 20% of its value since the **sell-off** began. It was down 5.8% on Friday alone. The S&P 500 fell 9.1%, its worst five-day trading **stretch since** March 2020.

There was little sign of such **moderation** in China’s **trenchant** response to the Trump tariffs, however.

The president has promised voters his “liberation day” policies will bring jobs and investment **pouring back** into the US. But investors fear the higher prices that are likely to result will depress consumer demand in the US, and put the brakes on export-dependent economies worldwide.

The market **meltdown** has also been fuelled by Trump’s unpredictability, which makes it impossible to forecast whether he will negotiate away some of the tariffs in exchange for **concessions** – or double down.

“Markets are crashing because markets are based on the stock value of companies who today are **embedded** in modes of production that are bad for the US,” he claimed.

Still, in the UK, some economists suggested the tariffs may have only a **modest** impact. James Smith, an economist at the analysts ING, said: “The **overall** hit from tariffs on Britain’s GDP is perhaps only 0.2% or so. Certainly not enough to decisively change the outlook for UK growth. And remember there are some **decent** **tailwinds** for growth this year, notably from government spending.”

#### [2025-04-08 Trump confirms 104% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of unfolding global trade war](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/trump-global-tariffs)


Donald Trump is poised to **unleash** his trade war with the world on Wednesday, **pressing ahead** with a **slew** of tariffs on the US’s largest trading partners despite fears of widespread economic damage and calls to reconsider.

However, Beijing vowed to “fight to the end” after Trump threatened to hit Chinese exports with additional 50% tariffs if the country **proceeds with plans** to retaliate against his initial **vow** to impose tariffs of 34% on its products.

“President Trump has a **spine** of steel and he will not break,” the **press secretary**, Karoline Leavitt, said.

The New Civil Liberties Alliance is a **libertarian** group.

The latest tariffs are higher than the 10% **flat rate** imposed on all global imports to the US on Friday last week and are **tailored** to specific countries based on a formula that has been criticised by economists that divides trade in goods deficit by twice the total value of imports.

Earlier in the day, the FTSE 100 rallied by 2.7% in London, recovering some of the losses it has endured since Trump’s announcement – on what was **dubbed** “liberation day” by his aides – last week. The Nikkei 225 **rallied** 6% in Tokyo. The Hang Seng Index rose 1.5% in Hong Kong.

If they come to the table with **solid** proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals.”

But he again raised the prospect of agreements with countries on Tuesday, **trailing** a potential deal with South Korea.

The president added: “‘**ONE STOP SHOPPING**’ is a beautiful and efficient process!!! China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”

Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, sought to ease concerns about market **volatility**, telling parliament she had spoken to Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, who confirmed “markets are functioning effectively and that our banking system is **resilient**”.

“What we don’t want to see is a trade war, with Britain becoming **inward-looking**.”

China adopted an **altogether** different stance. In a **scathing** editorial, the official state news outlet Xinhua accused the US president of “**naked** **extortion**”.

“**Utterly** **absurd** is the underlying logic of the United States: ‘I can hit you at my will, and you must not respond. Instead, you must surrender unconditionally,’” it said. “This is not diplomacy. It is **blunt** coercion dressed up as policy.”

#### [2025-05-12 Brazil’s president seeks ‘indestructible’ links with China amid Trump trade war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/brazil-china-trade-lula-da-silva-trump)

The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has **heralded** his desire to build “**indestructible**” relations with China, as the leaders of three of Latin America’s biggest economies flew to Beijing against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s trade war and the **profound** international uncertainty his presidency has generated.

Hours later Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, arrived, making a **beeline** for the Great Wall of China and declaring his desire for the South American country to not “only look one way” towards the US. “We have decided to take a profound step forward between China and Latin America,” Petro said.

Addressing hundreds of Chinese and Brazilian business chiefs in the Chinese capital on Monday, Lula **hit out** at Trump’s tariffs, saying he could not accept the measures “that the president of the US tried to impose on planet Earth, **from one day to the next**”.

The Brazilian leftist said he hoped to build an “indispensable” relationship with China – already Brazil’s top trading partner – and **heaped** praise on his Communist party hosts as his officials announced $4.6bn (£3.5bn) of Chinese investment in their country.

The visit of the three South American leaders to China underlines the east Asian country’s rapidly growing **footprint** in a region where, over the past 25 years, it has become a **voracious** consumer of commodities such as **soybeans**, **iron ore** and copper. Chinese companies have also **poured into** the region. Electric cars made by the Chinese manufacturer BYD can be seen **cruising** the streets of Brazilian cities, from Brasília to Boa Vista, deep in the Amazon.

The visits also come amid global **jitters** over Trump’s volatile presidency and Latin American anxiety and suspicion over the US president’s plans for a region where he has threatened to “take back” the Panama **canal** – by force if necessary.

“It tells us that countries around the world are willing to go out … to exploit all the opportunities that are there in the international system – and there are many. Because, as America turns away from free trade and as America **adopts** a policy that is … instead of **transactional**, **predatory** – countries have an incentive to engage with those who are transactional,” Spektor said, pointing to recent trips Lula made to Japan and Vietnam.

“Lula is very proactively trying to open trade for Brazil at a time when America is **undoing** the previous rules of the game, and the new rules of the game are not yet born … These Latin American countries want to shape the norms that are likely to emerge now. And those rules are not going to emerge in Washington DC. They are going to be made globally,” Spektor added.

“What happened on 20 January with Trump’s return to power is that the **barrage** of policy change coming from Washington DC has accelerated the belief that was already in place that the axis of global power has for a while been moving towards the east, and somewhat towards the south.”

After two days of talks between officials in Geneva over the weekend, China and the US agreed to **substantially** lower for the next 90 days the high tariffs each had imposed on the other in a tit-for-tat trade war.

Donald Trump hailed the talks as a “total reset” of the bilateral relationship but China’s responses made it clear that Beijing was still angry, and still blamed the US for **wreaking** economic chaos.

On Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry continued to condemn the “unreasonable” tariffs, urging the US to “stop smearing and **shifting blame**” for its fentanyl crisis on to China.

Chinese officials have repeatedly said Beijing opposes all tariffs and does not want to enter into a mutually **destructive** trade war but is willing to “fight to the end”.

“While we are glad to see the resumption of dialogue, we are also fully prepared for the long-term, complex and **arduous** **nature** of resolving differences between the two countries,” it said.

The tariff war has had an extraordinary impact on Chinese traders and manufacturers, with **shipments** grinding to a halt and an estimated 16m jobs at risk.

China now joins dozens of other countries in waiting to see if it can reach an agreement with the US not to restart **crushing** tariffs. On Monday, China’s commerce and finance ministries held discussions with foreign trade representatives about navigating the next three months and **weathering** the shocks of the tariffs.

Ms Bao, an assistant to the general manager of a Ningbo foreign trade company, said 30% of their **export volume** went to the US, and they were feeling cautiously optimistic about the 90-day pause.

One reader commenting on the Paper’s report said: “**Persistence** is victory!”

Others were more **sarcastic** about the “victory”. “Oh, did we win again?” said one person on Weibo. “The stock indexes react like we just lose.”

On Xiaohongshu, China’s Instagram, a user likened the pause to “changing the **ventilator** … on a dying patient”. “He can breathe, but he’s still far from being able to walk **briskly**,” they wrote.

#### [2025-05-22 World’s seven wealthiest countries agree to counter China’s trade practices](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/22/g7-china-trade)

Top finance officials from the world’s seven wealthiest democracies have set aside **stark differences** on US tariffs and agreed to counter global “economic imbalances”, a swipe at China’s **trade practices**.

Ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors there had been doubt about whether there would be a final **communique**, given divisions over US tariffs and Washington’s **reluctance** to refer to Russia’s war on Ukraine as illegal.

But after talks that stretched over three days, participants signed a lengthy document that was **devoid** of previous **language** on fighting climate change, left out their traditional defence of free trade and softened references to the Ukraine war.

“We found common ground on the most **pressing** global issues that we face,” Canadian finance minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told the closing press conference on Thursday.

The high-profile gathering of officials from the US, Canada, the UK, Japan, Germany, France and Italy appeared to be more **congenial** than an earlier meeting of G7 foreign ministers in March. That meeting, also in Canada, occurred as Donald Trump was in the middle of threatening **stiff** tariffs on Canada and suggesting it could become the 51st state.

“Our hand is **extended**,” Klingbeil added.

Champagne downplayed the lack of communique language on tariffs, but said ministers “were not **skating around**” the issue and discussed the effects during the meeting. Canada is seeking a deal to eliminate Trump’s 25% tariffs on many goods, including steel and **aluminium**.

The description of the Ukraine war was **watered down** from the prior G7 statement issued in October, before Trump’s re-election, calling it an “illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine”.

Trump has diminished US support for Ukraine and has made statements suggesting that Kyiv was to blame for the conflict as he tries to **coax** Russia into peace talks.

The finance meeting sets the stage for a G7 leaders summit June 15-17 in the nearby mountain **resort** area of Kananaskis. Trump will attend the summit, the White House confirmed on Thursday.

Few world leaders can say they’ve been hugged by Xi Jinping, China’s typically **reserved** president. Last year, an **embrace** between Xi and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, seemed to **sum up** the **cosy** – if **at times** slightly awkward – relationship between China and Russia.

Now Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, can count himself among the **hallowed** few to have broken the handshake barrier with Chinese leader. Stepping off the stage after giving a speech in Beijing earlier this month, Lula shook Xi’s hand, but the moment swiftly **melted into** something more **affectionate**.

Xi had good reason to be feeling warm towards the Brazilian leader. In Lula’s address to the China-CELAC forum, a dialogue between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries, he condemned US tariffs and said the Latin American region wanted to be “the axis of a multipolar order where the Global South is **duly** represented.”

Lula’s presence at the forum was itself a **coup** for China as it seeks to expand its global influence in Latin America. Lula was one of three heads of states to attend the conference, along with the presidents of Chile and Colombia. That was no accident. China had specifically courted the leaders of countries seen as being influential in the region and closer to the US, rather than those from the countries more naturally aligned with the Chinese Communist party, such as Venezuela and Cuba, who lack regional clout. Lula in particular got a full **bells-and-whistles** welcome to Beijing, with a military performance in Tiananmen Square including a 21 gun **salute**.

“Independence and autonomy are our glorious tradition. Development and **revitalisation** are our inherent right,” Xi said. China and the Latin American and Caribbean community have a “shared future”, he added.

While Brazil has maintained strong ties with the US, on the other hand its relationship with China is significant, said Chonn-Ching, as “both countries promote multilateralism as part of their foreign policy and see themselves as having leading roles in their **respective** regions and in the Global South.”

But while Trump’s vision for the global order is still coming into focus, Beijing has for years **trumpeted** the importance of a “multipolar” system of international cooperation. It is a sentiment that Lula echoes.

He wrote: “The call lasted approximately one and a half hours, and resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries. There should no longer be any questions **respecting** the complexity of Rare Earth products. Our respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined … During the conversation, President Xi **graciously** invited the First Lady and me to visit China, and I **reciprocated**.”

The agreement allowed for a reduction in tariffs during a 90-day **moratorium** before talks to resolve differences, especially over the export of Chinese rare earth **metals**, which are crucial to making electric cars and mobile phones.

China’s decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of critical minerals and **magnets** has disrupted supplies needed by carmakers, computer chip manufacturers and military contractors around the world.

Officials from the US and China have agreed on a “framework” to move forward on trade after two days of talks in London **stemming** from their confrontation over tariffs.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, expressed optimism on Tuesday that concerns about **critical** or “rare earth” minerals and magnets “will be resolved” as the deal is implemented.

Lutnick told reporters that the framework puts “meat on the bones” of a deal reached last month in Geneva to ease retaliatory tariffs. Its implementation had **faltered** over China’s curbs on critical mineral exports. The deal also would remove some US export restrictions that were recently put in place, Lutnick said.

Lutnick said China’s restrictions on exports of critical minerals and magnets to the US would be resolved as a “fundamental” part of the framework agreement. “Also, there were a number of measures the United States of America put on when those rare earths were not coming,” Lutnick said. “You should expect those to **come off**, sort of as President Trump said, in a balanced way.”

All eyes were on the outcomes of negotiations as both sides were at an **impasse** over export restrictions, with US officials earlier accusing Beijing of slow-walking approvals for shipments of critical minerals.

Just hours later though, they declined sharply, as it became clear that the **devil** would be in the detail, and the most **striking** part of the deal might in fact be aimed at Vietnam’s powerful neighbour China.

However, a 40% tariff will remain for so-called **transshipments** – a **provision** that is aimed at Chinese companies accused of passing their products through Vietnam, or elsewhere, to avoid US tariffs.

However, this caused the Vietnamese **trade surplus** with the US to surge, attracting US **ire** and allegations that Vietnam was wrongly acting as a **conduit** for Chinese companies wanting access to the US market.

Vietnam’s manufacturing industry is closely **intertwined** with both the US and China. US exports account for 30% of Vietnam’s GDP, while China is Vietnam’s top import source, relied on for raw materials used to make anything from **footwear** to furniture and electronics.

Vietnam is not alone in relying on China for such components, especially across electronic sectors. “China is completely **interwoven** into global supply chains,” says Dan Martin, international business adviser at Dezan Shira and Associates, based in Hanoi.

If companies are expected to prove the origin of all goods, this could place an unwelcome burden on those in sectors such as **textiles** where margins are low, says Martin.

Businesses are largely pausing decisions until a clearer **picture** emerges, say analysts.

Policymakers in Hanoi remain on a diplomatic tightrope. Vietnam has long sought to balance relations with Washington and Beijing. It considers the US not only a key export market but a security partner that serves as a counterbalance to China’s **assertiveness**.

However, if Beijing considers that Hanoi is helping Washington constrain it, this risks **antagonising** Vietnam’s northern neighbour. It could lead to economic measures from China, or pressure over the disputed South China Sea, a major flashpoint in the region, says Peter Mumford, head of practice for south-east Asia at Eurasia Group.

Vietnam has made efforts to show goodwill towards China over recent months, while also **courting** Trump.

However the market for cars remains small in Vietnam, where city streets are famously **crammed** with millions of motorbikes.

The CIA is on a **recruitment drive** for foreign spies. In their sights are Chinese officials and workers, who the US intelligence agency hopes to turn against Beijing via some newly released **glossy** videos.

The two videos touch on probable **anxieties** among some inside the Communist party machine – getting stuck in a lowly job assisting an increasingly wealthy corrupt official, or becoming victim to the endless purges that have targeted millions of party members at all levels since Xi Jinping came to power.

“As I rise within the party, I watch those above me being discarded like worn-out shoes, but now I realise that my fate was just as precarious as theirs,” a **narrator** says in one video, adding that he must protect his family whose fate is tied to his.

“Do you have any information about economic, fiscal, or trade policies?” the CIA asks in the **caption**.

“Do you work in the defence industry? Do you work in national security, diplomacy, science, advanced technology, or deal with people who work in these fields? Please contact us. The information you can provide is important and we value your **insights** on these topics.”

The campaign follows earlier efforts which began in October, with instructions posted online for potential assets in China, Iran and North Korea to get in touch with the CIA. The agency has said it has had previous success **enlisting** Russians.

The CIA has a particular focus on rebuilding an espionage network inside China. A couple of years before Xi came to power in 2012, China’s ministry of state security reportedly dismantled a US spy ring, jailing and **executing** at least a dozen CIA **assets**.

“It is intent on dominating the world economically, militarily, and technologically,” CIA director John Ratcliffe said in a statement. “Our agency must continue responding to this threat with urgency, creativity, and **grit**, and these videos are just one of the ways we are doing this.”

#### [2025-05-24 ‘Alarming’ rise in regional internet censorship in China, study finds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/24/alarming-rise-in-regional-internet-censorship-in-china-study-finds)

China’s authorities appear to have implemented an enhanced version of the country’s internet censorship **regime** in the central province of Henan, subjecting tens of millions of residents to even stricter controls on access to information than people in the rest of the country.

In 2022, thousands of people in Henan took part in several demonstrations after they were blocked from withdrawing cash from their bank accounts. The crisis escalated when protesters reported that their mobile health codes, part of the pandemic control measures in place at the time, had turned red, preventing them from travelling or entering buildings. Five officials were later punished for abusing the health code system to **quell** the protests.

Other parts of China have also been subjected to enhanced internet controls. In July 2009, following deadly ethnic **riots**, the Chinese government imposed an internet blackout in Xinjiang, a region in western China home to the Uyghur minority, that lasted 10 months. Since then, the use of the internet in Xinjiang has been much more tightly monitored than in the rest of the country. Online activities in Tibet are also strictly controlled.

The **emergence** of a regional censorship regime in Henan is unusual because it is not a region of China that is normally considered especially **restive** by the Chinese authorities.

Rapid advances in China’s artificial intelligence companies are a **boon** to both the censors and those who wish to **evade** them. China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS) recently unveiled new surveillance tools that can monitor people who use virtual private networks, software that allows people to circumvent the internet firewall. The MPS’s research institute also showcased a tool that it claimed could monitor accounts on Telegram, a messaging app. The tool has already collected more than 30bn messages, the institute claimed.

Mingshi Wu, the lead author of the Henan study, who uses a pseudonym to protect their identity, said: “On the one hand, AI could be leveraged to create more sophisticated, adaptive, and efficient censorship and surveillance tools. On the other hand, AI also enables new opportunities for those seeking to understand and circumvent censorship. For example, AI can assist in developing more **agile** testing tools for detecting censorship.”

The most vulnerable nations on Earth are facing a “**tidal** wave” of debt repayments as a Chinese **lending boom** starts to be called in, a new report has warned.

The pressure to repay was putting strain on local **funding** for health and education as well as climate change **mitigation**.

“China’s lending has collapsed exactly when it is needed most, instead creating large **net financial outflows** when countries are already under intense economic pressure,” it said.

The loans were largely issued under President Xi Jinping’s **signature** belt and road initiative (BRI), a state-backed global infrastructure investment programme which has **underwritten** national projects from schools, bridges and hospitals to **major roads** and shipping and air ports.

The lending **spree** turned China into the largest supplier of bilateral loans, peaking with a total of more than $50bn in 2016 – more than all western creditors combined.

The BRI focused primarily in developing nations, where governments struggled to access private or other state-backed investment. But the practice has raised concerns about Chinese influence and control and drawn accusations that Beijing was seeking to **entrap** recipient nations with **unserviceable** debt. Last month another analysis by the Lowy Institute found that Laos was now trapped in a severe debt crisis, in part because of over-investment in the domestic energy sector, mostly **financed** by China.

China’s government denies accusations it deliberately creates debt traps, and recipient nations have also **pushed back**, saying China was a more reliable partner and offered crucial loans when others refused.

But the situation also put China in a **bind**, pulled between diplomatic pressure to **restructure** unsustainable debt in vulnerable nations and domestic pressure to **recall** loans amid China’s own economic downturn.

A top Chinese general has been dismissed from the body that oversees the Chinese military in the latest sign that Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive has reached the highest **echelons** of the armed forces.

Miao Hua, a senior admiral from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) navy, was the director of the political work department of the central military commission (CMC), making him responsible for ideology and loyalty within the armed forces. The six-person CMC is one of the most powerful institutions in China and is headed by Xi himself.

On Friday, a statement from the Chinese government confirmed that Miao had been dismissed. He was suspended last year and placed under investigation for “serious violations of discipline”, a **byword** for corruption. He was expelled from the National People’s Congress, China’s parliament, in April.

The **dismissal** makes Miao one of the highest-ranking CMC officials to be purged since the 1960s, and the latest in a rush of senior military figures targeted.

He Weidong, a vice-chair of the CMC, is also reported to be under investigation.

The CMC is the governing body of the PLA, and oversees China’s coastguard. Xi is the chair of the CMC, as well as being the leader of China’s ruling Communist party (CCP) and the president.

Miao’s dismissal reflects the latest **ructions** in China’s armed forces. Beijing is keen to present an image of strength and stability on the world stage. The purges risk disrupting that image, although at a time when global attention is focused on wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, senior personnel changes in China’s military may garner less attention.

US-China military dialogue, seen as essential for avoiding accidental conflicts, particularly in the Taiwan strait, have been limited under the presidency of Donald Trump, who has also fired several senior military officials. US military representatives travelled to Shanghai for talks in April, but there have been no public signs of high-ranking meetings.

The US and Chinese defence ministers sometimes meet at the Shangri-la Dialogue, an annual defence forum which was held in Singapore last month. But this year China only sent a small, lower-ranking delegation.

In the past two years, Xi has dismissed two defence ministers, Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe; two heads of the PLA’s rocket force, which is responsible for missiles and the nuclear arsenal, and two senior CMC officials. Senior aerospace and defence business leaders have also been removed from a CCP advisory body.

Many of the recent oustings appear to be related to an investigation into corruption in military **procurement**. Li, who was dismissed as defence minister in 2023 and expelled from the CCP last year, previously led the equipment procurement department. Several of his associates from the military and the equipment procurement department were also purged.

Xi took power with a promise to root out corruption in China, vowing to come after both the “tigers and the flies”. Since then, millions of officials have been investigated, and hundreds of thousands reportedly **penalised**, including high-profile people being expelled or **prosecuted**.

Having now ruled for more than a decade, however, many of the senior figures coming into the **crosshairs** of anti-corruption campaigns are people, such as Miao and Li, who Xi had personally appointed, raising questions about his ability to **vet** important appointments.

Speculation that he was under investigation ran **rampant** until October when Beijing announced he had been removed from his post. No reason was given.

A new **code** of conduct in Hong Kong will require legislators to “sincerely support” Beijing’s jurisdiction on the city and the chief executive, and **prohibits** anything that might “vilify” the government.

The proposal for the new code, introduced on Wednesday, included **tiered** penalties for legislators who breach the code, including **suspension** without payment for the most serious offences.

It **stipulated** that legislators must “sincerely support the central government’s overall jurisdiction while securing the Hong Kong SAR’s special administrative region’s high degree of autonomy”, as well as the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong”, referring to election reforms which ensure that only pro-Beijing candidates can run.

Hong Kong’s governance system has undergone major **overhauls** in recent years, after a crackdown on the city’s pro-democracy movement and politicians saw major interventions by the government in Beijing.

Every major democratic party has **disbanded** or begun the process of disbandment, and thousands of people – including politicians and activists – have been prosecuted under national security laws.

A separate proposal this week flags new prison rules which include only allowing visits pre-approved by the **correctional** services department, would empower the department to consider restrictions on **clergy** visits, and seek rulings to bar visits by specific legal representatives to imprisoned clients.

“In fact, they are using soft means to influence prisoners, intending to incite them to resist the **supervision** of the correctional services department, **arouse** their hatred towards the central government and the SAR government, and even make them become potential risks to national security and public safety after returning to society.”

A decade on from China’s biggest crackdown on human rights lawyers in modern history, lawyers and activists say that the Chinese Communist party’s control over the legal **profession** has tightened, making rights defence work next to impossible.

The environment for human rights law has “steadily **regressed**, especially after the pandemic”, said Ren Quanniu, a **disbarred** human rights lawyer. During that time judicial organs were attacked as “**bourgeois**” and the **nascent** court system was largely suspended.

According to human rights groups and the US government, about 300 people from the loose collective of a **burgeoning** rights defence movement, known as weiquan, were targeted in the **round-up**. At least 10 were convicted of crimes such as “subversion of state power” and given jail terms, while dozens more have been subjected to **surveillance**, harassment and the revocation of their professional licences in the years since.

Lawyers scored wins for defendants in cases ranging from **tainted** baby milk formula scandals to the abuse of migrant workers.

“It’s hard to say we achieved success – we can only say that the services we provided have made it more difficult for the authorities to **persecute** certain groups,” said Jiang Tianyong, a 54-year-old former human rights lawyer known for taking on cases involving religious and ethnic minorities who served two years in prison for “inciting subversion of state power”.

The **daily grind** was not about **promulgating** foreign ideas, said Ren.

Under Xi’s rule, activists have been rounded up, independent law firms and NGOs have been **reined** in, and any kind of organised activity outside the **auspices** of the Communist party (CCP) has been tightly restricted.

“The Chinese government under Xi Jinping has sought to **eradicate** the influence of lawyers who defend people’s rights,” said Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch.

Ren escaped the first wave of **reprisals** after the 709 incident.

Those without licences try to offer **informal** advice to people in need, but their ability is severely limited.

“Although the year of the 709 incident marked a major regression in the rule of law in China … people, I believe, are gradually building resilience, **maturing** and becoming stronger.”

The federal employee works for the US **Patent** and **Trademark** Office, and was visiting China in a **personal capacity**, according to the state department.

Exit bans are a controversial mechanism used by the Chinese government to bar both Chinese citizens and foreigners from leaving, for reasons ranging from criminal investigations to unsettled **civil disputes**, but is also used as a **leverage tool** in diplomatic disputes.

The exact reasons for the federal employee’s exit ban are unclear, but the Washington Post had previously reported that the worker, whose identity has not been released, was stopped from leaving the country after he failed to **disclose** his government employment on the visa application. He reportedly had also served in the US Army.

“Chenyue Mao is involved in a criminal case currently being handled by Chinese **law-enforcement authorities** and is subject to exit restrictions in accordance with the law,” Guo said.

Wells Fargo has since banned all employees from travelling to China since Mao – a **naturalised** US citizen of **Chinese descent** – was stopped from leaving.

A 2023 report by Safeguard Defenders said that since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, “China has expanded the **legal landscape** for exit bans and increasingly used them, sometimes outside legal justification”.

Exit bans have been used against activists and journalists – including foreign **correspondents** – and family members of the people actually of interest to the Chinese government. In 2019 two American siblings were allowed to return home after three years trapped in China. Cynthia and Victor Liu were subject to an exit ban, despite not facing any criminal allegations.

China and the Philippines have displayed their national flags in competing photo opportunities on a disputed **sandbank** in the South China sea, **ratcheting** up longstanding regional tensions between the two countries.

The dispute played out at Sandy Cay, which is part of the disputed Spratly Islands, and comes days after the US and the Philippines launched their annual joint military drills called “Balikatan”, or “shoulder to shoulder”, which this year will include an **integrated** air and missile defence **simulation** for the first time.

The latest confrontation appears to have emerged on Thursday, when Chinese state media reported the Coast Guard landed on the disputed **reef** two weeks ago, **unfurled** a flag and “exercised sovereign jurisdiction”.

On Sunday, China’s coast guard then accused six Filipino personnel of “illegally boarding” Sandy Cay, which Beijing calls Tiexian Reef, earlier that day despite “warnings and **dissuasion**” from the Chinese side.

Sandy Cay is just a few kilometres from Thitu island, where the Philippines maintains a military **outpost**.

“Hegseth deliberately ignored the call for peace and development by countries in the region, and instead touted the cold war mentality for bloc confrontation, **vilified** China with **defamatory** allegations, and falsely called China a ‘threat’,” it said.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday morning, Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, rejected the **premise** of China’s criticism of Hegseth.

“What we have seen from China is the single biggest increase in military capability and buildup in a **conventional sense** by any country since the end of the second world war,” he said.

“That is one of the key features of the **complexity** of the strategic landscape which all of us face within the region and which is faced around the world.”

The US is not a **signatory** to that convention.

Past years have often seen the US and China trade **barbs**, but also occasionally hold significant meetings, including last year with China’s defence minister, Dong Jun, and Hegseth’s predecessor, Lloyd Austin.

This year, however, China sent only a small delegation led by a vice-president of the People’s Liberation Army’s national defence university, **Rear Adm** Hu Gangfeng.

Referencing China’s absence, Chan said Beijing should use “every opportunity” available to **get** its position **across**.

“But **regardless of** whether China attends the dialogue, it is **incumbent** on all of us to reach out to China in different forums … to not end up in a situation where either side **misinterprets**, miscalculates, or **misrepresents** each other’s position. That is dangerous.”

The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, did not say if the government had **lodged** a formal protest, saying only that it had “conveyed an appropriate message to the Chinese side”.

The incursion into Pacific waters about 300km south-west of Minamitori island will add to concern in Tokyo and Washington about China’s increasingly **assertive** naval and air activity in and around Japanese waters.

The countries are **embroiled** in a longstanding territorial dispute over the Senkakus – uninhabited islets in the east China Sea that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, where they are known as the Diaoyu.

This is the first time, however, that a Chinese vessel has entered that part of Japan’s EEZ – an area within 200 **nautical** miles (370km) of its coastline – a defence ministry spokesperson told Agence France-Presse.

After leaving the EEZ, the Chinese carrier group conducted **landing and take-off** drills involving fighter jets and helicopters, the ministry said, adding that Japan had deployed a warship, Haguro, to monitor the situation.

Minamitori, the **easternmost** point of the Japanese **archipelago**, is surrounded by large **deposits** of rare metals. Last year, experts from the Nippon Foundation and Tokyo University said about 200m tonnes of **manganese** **nodules** rich in rare metals existed on the seabed near the island.

China installed 93 GW of solar capacity last month – almost 100 solar panels every second, according to an analysis by Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Wind power installations reached 26 GW, the equivalent of about 5,300 **turbines**.

Trump withdrew from many major environmental protection treaties, such as the Paris climate agreement which aims to limit global warming to well below two degrees **celsius** above preindustrial levels.

China is the world’s biggest emitter of **greenhouse gases** but is also the world’s biggest supplier and installer of clean energy technology.

Xi Jinping, China’s leader, is increasingly connecting China’s climate ambitions with the growth of the clean energy technology sector, which he sees as vital to boosting China’s **flagging** economy.

But the **hyper-competitiveness** of China’s economy is also putting pressure on clean energy firms, with prices of solar panels barely covering the cost of production.

The four countries said in a joint statement that they were establishing the Quad Critical Minerals Initiative, aimed at “collaborating on securing and **diversifying**” supply chains.

They offered little detail but made clear the goal was to reduce reliance on China, which has used restrictions **as leverage** as the US in turn curbs its access to semiconductors and threatens steep tariffs.

China holds major reserves of several key minerals including the vast majority of the world’s **graphite**, which is crucial for electric vehicles.

In a joint statement, the Quad countries said: “Reliance on any one country for processing and refining critical minerals and **derivative** goods production exposes our industries to economic coercion, price manipulation and supply chain disruptions.”

Rubio had welcomed the Quad foreign ministers on 21 January in his first meeting after Trump’s inauguration, seen as a sign the new administration would prioritise engagement with **like-minded** countries to counter China.

But to the surprise of many, China has not topped the **early agenda** of Trump, who has spoken respectfully about his counterpart, Xi Jinping, and moved to ease tensions in a wider trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Both the Indian and Japanese foreign ministers said they wanted the Quad to focus on a “free and open Indo-Pacific” – a **phrasing** that is a **veiled** **allusion** to opposing Chinese dominance in Asia.

“It is **essential** that nations of the Indo-Pacific have the freedom of choice, so essential to make right decisions on development and security,” Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said.

At Jaishankar’s urging, the Quad also condemned a May attack on the Indian side of Kashmir that killed mostly Hindu civilians and called for “the **perpetrators**, organisers and financiers of this **reprehensible** act to be brought to justice without any delay”.

In a key concern for Japan, the Quad condemned North Korea for its “destabilising launches” of missiles and insisted on its “complete **denuclearisation**”.

India has maintained its long relationship with Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine, while both India and Japan also have historically enjoyed **cordial** ties with Iran.

#### [2025-07-02 ‘A billion people backing you’: China transfixed as Musk turns against Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/02/a-billion-people-backing-you-china-transfixed-as-musk-turns-against-trump)

Few **break-ups** have as many **gossiping** observers as the fallout between the once **inseparable** Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

The ill-fated bromance between the US president and the world’s richest man, which once raised questions about American **oligarchy**, is now being **pored** over by social media users in China, many of whom are Team Musk.

Musk had already vowed to unseat lawmakers who backed Trump’s **flagship** piece of legislation, which is expected to increase US national debt by $3.3tn.

One comment **summed up** the mood on the platform: “Brother Musk, you’ve got over a billion people on our side backing you.”

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is widely **venerated** in China for his business **acumen** and technological achievements. Tesla’s electric vehicles are the only western brand on Chinese roads that can rival domestic firms, and the company’s biggest factory by volume is in Shanghai. Musk is known to have a close relationship with China’s premier, Li Qiang, while Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, is a social media celebrity **in her own right** in China.

Musk’s popularity in China follows a well-established trend of Chinese audiences **enthusiastically** embracing US tech innovators. Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs was a bestseller in China, as was his biography of Musk.

Trump, however, is seen by many as being an unpredictable funnyman who has launched the most **aggressive** trade war on China in recent history.

Some internet users commented that Trump and Musk should grow up. “These two grown men argue **nonstop** over the smallest things – and the whole world ends up knowing about it,” wrote one user, while another joked: “Every day, Musk is basically live-streaming ‘How Billionaires Argue’”.

The conversation has been allowed to **flourish** on China’s tightly controlled social media, suggesting that at least some censors are betting that the US political chaos could be no bad thing for China.

#### [2025-07-02 Dalai Lama defies China to say successor will be chosen by Tibetan tradition](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/02/dalai-lama-says-there-will-be-search-for-his-successor-ending-years-of-speculation)

The Dalai Lama has declared in a direct challenge to China that the **centuries-old** spiritual institution bearing his name will continue after his death and that only his inner circle, not Beijing, will have the authority to identify his successor.

In a video message played on Wednesday during prayer celebrations ahead of his 90th birthday this weekend, the 14th Dalai Lama said the Gaden Phodrang Trust, which manages his affairs, would oversee the search for his **reincarnation**.

“In accordance with all these requests, I am affirming that the **institution** of the Dalai Lama will continue,” he told the gathering of senior Buddhist monks. He said clear written instructions would be left behind, but did not **elaborate** on their contents.

China annexed Tibet in 1951 and has retained tight control over the region ever since. It has said the choice of the next Dalai Lama lies only with Beijing, and has **enshrined** state **assent** for all senior Tibetan religious leaders in law. It insists the golden **urn** – a Qing dynasty **ritual** in which names are drawn by lot from a ceremonial vessel – is the only legitimate method for recognising reincarnated lamas. The Communist party must approve the final selection.

The boy and his family vanished into Chinese **custody** days later and have not been seen since. China **installed** its own candidate, widely rejected by Tibetans. According to Chinese state media, the Beijing-backed Panchen Lama met President Xi Jinping just last month and pledged loyalty to the Communist party.

Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama is the **earthly** **manifestation** of Avalokiteshvara, a **revered** figure in Buddhism known as the **bodhisattva** of **compassion** – a spiritual being who remains in the world to guide others on the path to **enlightenment**.

By tradition, only the current Dalai Lama, or those he appoints, can identify his successor, using visions, **omens** and consultation with senior lamas and protectors of the faith.

The deputy speaker of the Tibetan parliament in exile, Dolma Tsering Teykhang, said: “The world needs to hear directly from His Holiness. China tries to **vilify** him at every chance … It is trying to frame rules and regulations on how to have the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in their hand.”

“He has been an **enduring** symbol of love, compassion, patience and moral discipline,” he added.

Modi’s **effusive** support is significant.

“We support efforts to preserve Tibetans’ **distinct** **linguistic**, cultural and religious **heritage**, including their ability to freely choose and venerate religious leaders without interference,” the statement added.

Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te – who leads an island that China says is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to seize – said in a statement read at the ceremony that the example set by the Dalai Lama “**resonates** with all who **cherish** freedom, democracy and respect for human rights”.

“At a time when we see the forces of division tearing at the **fabric** of our common humanity … I’m grateful for your enduring efforts to build a better, kinder, more compassionate world,” Bill Clinton said.

On a remote stretch of land in the Cook Islands lies a second world war **airstrip**. Once used as a wartime supply route by American forces, the narrow runway is in **dire** need of **resealing** to allow larger tourist jets to land.

The country of about 17,000 people has seen ties with its biggest ally and former colonial partner New Zealand **fray** as leaders draw it closer to Beijing.

But others, such as the opposition leader, Tina Browne, were **vocal** in their criticism of Beijing building its influence in the Cook Islands.

In the sleepy seaside town, one of the main attractions is standing at the **seawall** to watch planes land.

Fruit and vegetable seller Teremoana Napa spent 40 years living and working in New Zealand before returning to the Cook Islands. She is now on New Zealand’s **pension**.

“The New Zealand passport gives us so much,” she says. “We don’t want a Cook Islands passport, that’s a **bloody** **dead-end** passport.”

Others share concern over the loss of crucial aid from Wellington. Outside the country’s main hospital, Calais Ngatan helps his heavily **pregnant** wife to the car.

The deal signed in February between the Cook Islands and China **encompasses** a series of cooperation agreements designed to support the domestic economy.

The two countries have agreed to collaborate on scientific research, joint **expeditions**, education and training. Powles says there is a “race” for critical minerals for their defence application and for that reason China is “actively engaged in finding opportunities and **formalising** partnerships with countries who are interested in mining their deep-sea minerals within their waters”.

The activity has prompted concern in Rarotonga. Don Beer, head of Cook Islands’ Fishing Association, is firmly opposed to seabed mineral exploration, citing concerns about its potential impact on already declining fish stocks. His **unease** is **compounded** by China’s growing interest not just in minerals but also in the Cook Islands’ **maritime** resources.

Powles says that for Beijing, deepening relations with the Cook Island **shores up** “closer diplomatic ties with Pacific Island partners and that helps to influence and shape a regional order”. From New Zealand’s perspective, she notes, the aid freeze was a sign of just how fragile the relationship has become.

“It is quite an extreme move to pause aid,” she says. “New Zealand has been increasingly clear over the years that, particularly in the security **realm**, that it sees China as a **disruptor** and a destabilising actor in the Pacific.”

Next month, the Cook Islands will mark 60 years of self-government in free association with New Zealand. As preparations for a massive inter-island celebration unfold, the event is **tinged** with diplomatic unease. Cook Islands has invited New Zealand to attend – Wellington says their attendance is still “under consideration”.

At a press briefing in Beijing last month, Foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said China’s cooperation with the Cook Islands “targets no third party, nor should it be **interfered** with or **constrain**ed by any third party”.

#### [2025-07-17 Restaurant in China criticised for putting baby lion cuddles on menu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/17/restaurant-china-baby-lion-cuddles-menu)

A restaurant in northern China has been criticised by animal **welfare** groups for offering an unusual item on the menu: lion **cub** **cuddles**.

According to a screenshot of a menu circulating on social media, Wanhui – a restaurant in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province – has a **four-course** set afternoon menu costing 1,192 yuan ($166/£124) that includes playtime with the in-house animals.

The restaurant’s **profile** on Dazhong Dianping, a popular restaurant listings app, shows pictures of the lion cubs alongside other animals, such as deer and **alligators**.

The menu on the Dianping page does not include lions in its list of animals but says customers can play with **llamas**, turtles and **meerkats**.

Several photos show customers **snuggling** the baby lions.

In one review posted this month, a customer sits with a lion cub on her **lap**, holding the its paw to wave to the camera.

Peter Li, a China policy expert for Humane World for Animals, told Reuters: “Exploiting wild animals for **selfies** and marketing **gimmicks** is not only **appallingly** bad animal welfare, it’s also potentially risky for customers.”

It is not the first **exotic** animal welfare scandal in China. Last month, tourists visiting a zoo in Liaoning, in the north-east, were condemned for reaching through a metal grate to pull tufts of hair off a tiger.

A hotel in Chongqing, a city in south-west China, recently attracted **scorn** for offering a “wake-up service” delivered by red pandas, which could climb into guests’ beds.

Contact between humans and exotic animals has also been highlighted by experts as a potential risk for the spread of **zoonotic** diseases, such as Covid-19.

According to Reuters, the restaurant said the lion cubs were well cared for by **specialist staff**.

#### [2025-07-21 China starts building world’s biggest hydropower dam](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/21/china-starts-building-world-biggest-hydropower-dam-yarlung-tsangpo-river-tibet)

Construction of the world’s biggest **hydropower** megadam has begun, China’s premier has said, calling it the “project of the century”.

The dam has drawn criticism from India and **Bangladesh**, through which the river runs, as well as Tibetan groups and environmentalists.

The project announced by Li is planned for the **lower reaches** of the river, according to the official state news outlet, Xinhua. Xinhua reported that the project would consist of five cascade hydropower stations, producing an estimated 300 million **megawatt** hours of electricity annually at a cost of about 1.2tn yuan (£124bn).

In comparison, the Three **Gorges** dam cost 254.2bn yuan and generates 88.2m MWh.

China, the world’s biggest carbon emitter, is operating a huge renewable energy **expansion** as it seeks to reach emissions reduction goals and stabilise its power supply. It has tens of thousands of hydropower projects, far more than any other country.

The Yarlung Tsangpo megadam will reportedly **harness** the power created by the river dropping 2km in about 50km as it winds through a **canyon** on a U-shaped **bend**.

“China can always weaponise this water in terms of blocking it or diverting it,” Neeraj Singh Manhas, **special adviser** for South Asia at the Parley Policy Initiative, told the BBC in January.

Last year hundreds of people were arrested while protesting against the Kamtok dam on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river, which they said threatened to displace thousands of residents and submerge ancient Buddhist **monasteries**. The Three Gorges Dam is estimated to have displaced about 1.5 million people.

Environmentalists have also expressed concern about wildlife in the region, as well as the significant **tectonic** shifting, severe landslides and extreme geography where the dam is expected to go.

The Chinese government rejects the criticism, and says the project will stimulate jobs in the region, increase domestic energy supplies and **spur** on development in the renewables sector. “Special emphasis must be placed on **ecological** **conservation** to prevent environmental damage,” Li said.

#### [2025-07-22 Arrests in China after more than 230 kindergarten children poisoned by lead paint in food](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/22/arrests-in-china-after-more-than-230-kindergarten-children-poisoned-by-lead-paint-in-food-ntwnfb)

Chinese authorities have arrested six people and launched disciplinary investigations into almost 30 others after more than 230 kindergarten children were poisoned by food coloured with industrial-grade **lead paint**.

The incident, which occurred in Gansu province earlier this month, is one of China’s worst school food safety incidents and has drawn national attention. An investigative report released by the Gansu provincial party committee on Sunday found a **litany** of failures in safety and oversight, as well as attempts to **cover up** the incident, **bribe** people in charge and modify test results.

The report said the **principal** at the Tianshui kindergarten had wanted to attract more **enrolments** by “enhancing” the colour and look of the food served to children. The school’s cook bought industrial-grade **pigment** online, adding it to dishes despite the packages saying it was “not for **consumption**”.

Initially, 235 students were hospitalised after eating the coloured food. Local state media quoted a parent at the time saying children had suffered stomach pain and **nausea**, and some children’s teeth had turned black.

It said the Gansu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention **neglected** the case after accepting it, and took samples in a way that violated health regulations and led to a “huge difference” in the test results and the actual levels.

“The management of Tianshui Second People’s hospital and its **laboratory** department was chaotic, job responsibilities were not fully implemented, laboratory quality control was not fully implemented and **relevant** inspection personnel lacked systematic training,” the report said.

It said the children had been treated and all but one had been **discharged** after the first round of treatment, during which lead levels dropped by an average of 40%.

The footage showed officers using physical force, including **batons**, and angry parents confronting individuals in **plain clothes**, questioning their use of violence. As police cars appeared to try to escort the plain-clothed individuals away, parents blocked the road, shouting: “Hand over those who beat people up.”
