Sri Lanka and Indonesia have deployed military personnel as they race to help victims of **devastating** flooding.

Millions of people have been affected by a combination of tropical cyclones and heavy **monsoon** rains in Sri Lanka.

The flooding has submerged homes, **inundated** agricultural fields. Some people **clung** to trees or stood on rooftops.

By Sunday afternoon, rain had **subsided** across Sri Lanka.

Military helicopters have been deployed to **airlift** stranded people and deliver food.

He said solar **lamps** were being distributed.

Extreme rainfall from tropical cyclones has increased **substantially**, as warmer air holds more water **vapour**.

“Ukraine’s got some difficult little problems,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, referring to a corruption investigation that recently forced President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to **sack** his chief of staff and top negotiator.

“We continue to be **realistic** about how difficult this is, but optimistic.”

A Ukrainian security source said Kyiv was responsible for attacks by **naval** drones on two oil tankers off Turkey’s Black Sea coast that it believed were covertly transporting sanctioned Russian oil. And the Ukrainian government has faced **turbulence**.

“Peace is within reach, if Vladimir Putin abandons his delusional hope of **reconstituting** the Soviet empire by first **subjugating** Ukraine,” he added.

Donald Trump reportedly gave Nicolás Maduro an ultimatum to **relinquish** power immediately.

Maduro reportedly requested a second call last weekend after Trump declared Venezuela’s airspace “closed in its **entirety**”.

It believed “**deposing** Maduro is in the US national interest”.

Maduro accused the US of seeking to “appropriate Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – through the **lethal** use of military force”.

In Aceh, one of the hardest hit areas, prices have **tripled**.

The World Health Organization said it was strengthening disease **surveillance**.

Survivors have described how powerful **currents** of water arrived rapidly and submerged villages.

“There was no prior warning whatsoever before the water came,” said a student at an Islamic **boarding school**.

This year’s **downpours** were **compounded** by a rare tropical storm formed in the Malacca Strait.

That would be China’s biggest diplomatic **outpost** in the world. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that **consolidating** China’s seven existing diplomatic sites in London into a single embassy “clearly brings security advantages”.

In a speech on Monday night, he argued that the government could not continue to **blow “hot and cold”** on China and needed to strike a balance.

He described China as a “nation of immense scale, ambition and **ingenuity**” and “a **defining** force in technology, in trade and global governance”.

“Our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by **illusion**. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and **sober** realism,” Starmer said.

Yvette Cooper said their departments had “carefully considered the **breadth** of considerations” related to the proposed embassy.

“We discussed the **essence** of what is embedded in these American documents.”

“The president also did not hide our **critical** and even negative attitude towards a number of proposals.”

He added that the US hoped a compromise would allow them “not just to rebuild their economy, but to **prosper** as a country”.

The relatively **downbeat** assessments of Tuesday night’s diplomacy follows combative opening statements from Putin.

The US delegation was in an intense round of **shuttle** diplomacy that the Trump administration has claimed is its best chance yet of bringing an end to the war.

A short video **feed** from the Kremlin showed the two small delegations sitting on opposite sides of an oval white table.

He has also demanded clear, **enforceable** security guarantees from the west to prevent a future Russian invasion.

Putin’s comments appeared aimed at driving a **wedge** between Washington and European capitals.

**Buoyed** up by recent gains at the front, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy **faltered**.

The Russian president threatened that Moscow would “step up strikes on Ukrainian ports and on any ships entering them” in response to attacks on Russian tankers, which he described as “**piracy**”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/03/search-for-malaysia-airline-flight-mh370-to-resume-over-11-years-after-plane-went-missing

In a statement on Wednesday, the transport ministry confirmed that the marine **robotics** company Ocean Infinity, based in the UK and US, would resume a search of the seabed from 30 December, over a period of 55 days, with operations conducted **intermittently**.

Flight MH370 **veered** off course and vanished from air traffic radar on 8 March 2014, during a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

In the years since the disappearance, vast swathes of the Indian Ocean have been **scoured** in an attempt to locate the plane’s wreckage through **multinational** and private efforts, without success.

Last year, Malaysia said it was willing to reopen an investigation into the disappearance if there was **compelling** new evidence.

Flight MH370, a B777-200 aircraft, had departed Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time on 8 March 2014, **bound for** Beijing.

Some travelled to Madagascar in 2016 to **comb** the beaches for debris.

Later that year, Australian investigators delivered their final report on the disappearance, saying the inability to **bring closure** for victims’ families was a “great tragedy” and “almost **inconceivable**” in the modern age.

He pledged that “**righteous** unity” would be possible only once accountability was delivered.

However, on a typically **crisp** winter’s afternoon in Seoul that **belied** the significance of the day, that sense of unity appeared as distant as ever.

Several hundred supporters of ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol – the **instigator** of the ill-fated martial law attempt – gathered near the national assembly.

The command aimed to ban political activities, authorise **warrantless** arrests and deploy 280 armed troops to the national assembly.

Thousands of citizens rushed to the parliament building – some helping MPs **scale** its walls to reach the chamber – 190 lawmakers voted unanimously to overturn the decree.

Prosecutors allege Yoon ordered drone flights near Pyongyang in October 2024 in the hope that a retaliatory response could serve as a **pretext** for martial law.

Despite Lee’s calls for unity, the political and social **fractures** exposed during the crisis remain raw.

“Deepening **polarisation** raises serious concerns about the long-term health of Korean democracy.”

In its editorial on Wednesday, the conservative Chosun Ilbo accused the Lee administration of an unprecedented “**rampage** and tyranny” in the way it has governed since taking office.

The liberal Hankyoreh, by contrast, warned that **sluggish** investigations and stalled court proceedings risk enabling insufficient accountability.

“Genuine **reconciliation** and meaningful reforms will be necessary to address the root causes,” she said. “The **trauma** of the martial law episode has left lasting scars.”

Der Spiegel said it had obtained an English summary of Monday’s call, featuring what it said were direct **quotations** from European heads of government in which they expressed fundamental doubts about Washington’s approach to the talks.

The magazine said other leaders also voiced their concerns, with Finland’s Alexander Stubb, who has **bonded with** Trump over golf.

Even the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte – who in public is very **complimentary** of Trump – reportedly said he agreed with Stubb “that we need to protect Volodymyr”.

Two of them reportedly said the remarks were “accurately **reproduced**”.

In a **guest column** for the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Merz argued for the use of frozen Russian state assets to support Ukraine.

Law enforcement agencies have yet to arrest the suspected **masterminds** of the **lucrative** networks.

In October, the US justice department indicted Chen for **wire fraud** conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy for allegedly directing Prince Group’s operation of forced-labour scam compounds across Cambodia.

Another alleged scam operation involved Yim Leak, who Thai authorities described as “the heir of an influential network in Cambodia” that conducted **fraudulent** transactions.

The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the Russian president “should end the **bluster** and the bloodshed” and sit down to negotiate peace.

His latest remarks may **prick** the ears of Donald Trump, who, after once **haranguing** Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, drastically changed his tune, at least for a time, after Charles **indulged** the US president with a state visit and impressed upon him the broader importance of Ukraine’s defence.

Trump on Wednesday continued to loosely **preside over** attempts to strike a peace deal. Trump said Putin would like to make a deal but “what comes out of that meeting I can’t tell you because it does take two to **tango**”.

Ukraine’s military general staff announced recent strikes on Russian targets including a Black Sea observation post on an **oil rig**.

However a sanctions “**loophole**” has allowed Russian oil products refined elsewhere to find their way to Australia.
