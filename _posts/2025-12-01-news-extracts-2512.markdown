Sri Lanka and Indonesia have deployed military personnel as they race to help victims of **devastating** flooding.

Millions of people have been affected by a combination of tropical cyclones and heavy **monsoon** rains in Sri Lanka.

The flooding has submerged homes, **inundated** agricultural fields. Some people **clung** to trees or stood on rooftops.

By Sunday afternoon, rain had **subsided** across Sri Lanka.

Military helicopters have been deployed to **airlift** stranded people and deliver food.

He said solar **lamps** were being distributed.

Extreme rainfall from tropical cyclones has increased **substantially**, as warmer air holds more water **vapour**.

“Ukraine’s got some difficult little problems,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, referring to a corruption investigation that recently forced President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to **sack** his chief of staff and top negotiator.

“We continue to be **realistic** about how difficult this is, but optimistic.”

A Ukrainian security source said Kyiv was responsible for attacks by **naval** drones on two oil tankers off Turkey’s Black Sea coast that it believed were covertly transporting sanctioned Russian oil. And the Ukrainian government has faced **turbulence**.

“Peace is within reach, if Vladimir Putin abandons his delusional hope of **reconstituting** the Soviet empire by first **subjugating** Ukraine,” he added.

Donald Trump reportedly gave Nicolás Maduro an ultimatum to **relinquish** power immediately.

Maduro reportedly requested a second call last weekend after Trump declared Venezuela’s airspace “closed in its **entirety**”.

It believed “**deposing** Maduro is in the US national interest”.

Maduro accused the US of seeking to “appropriate Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – through the **lethal** use of military force”.

In Aceh, one of the hardest hit areas, prices have **tripled**.

The World Health Organization said it was strengthening disease **surveillance**.

Survivors have described how powerful **currents** of water arrived rapidly and submerged villages.

“There was no prior warning whatsoever before the water came,” said a student at an Islamic **boarding school**.

This year’s **downpours** were **compounded** by a rare tropical storm formed in the Malacca Strait.

Families stranded on their rooftops. Homes buried by fast-flowing mud. Jagged brown craters scarring lush green hillsides.

The scenes are the result of a series of cyclones and storms in a heavy monsoon season that have struck Asia with torrential rains, gutting essential infrastructure and reshaping landscapes. The violent weather has killed at least 1,200 people in the past week and forced a million to flee without knowing whether their homes will still be standing when they go back.

The fallout marks a grim escalation in deadly weather across the region that has been aggravated by the blanket of carbon pollution heating the planet. A review by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that south and south-east Asia will suffer more intense rain as temperatures rise, with a “large increase” in flood frequency striking monsoon regions.

Roxy Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and coauthor of the latest IPCC report, said the cyclones’ behaviour had changed more than their number this season. “They are wetter and more destructive because the background climate has shifted,” he said. “Water, not wind, is now the main driver of disaster.”

Natural weather patterns including a La Niña cycle and a negative Indian Ocean dipole have helped to create conditions for the storms to form. Scientists have not determined the extent to which planet-heating pollution contributed to the death toll, which continues to rise with floodwaters, but they have long established that warmer air holds more moisture – about 7% per degree Celsius.

The extra water, together with the increase in energy from hotter oceans, leads to the formation of storms that pack far more punch.

“Across south and south-east Asia, storms this season have been carrying extraordinary amounts of moisture,” said Koll. “A warmer ocean and atmosphere are loading these systems with water, so even moderate cyclones now unleash rainfall that overwhelms rivers, destabilises slopes and triggers cascading disasters.

“Landslides and flash floods then strike the most vulnerable, the communities living along these fragile environments.”

The rains have loosened soils and levelled slopes in hilly regions that have wiped out villages and rendered roads and railways unusable. The floods have also hampered rescue efforts by disrupting electricity supplies and phone networks.

In Indonesia, where freshly cut logs have washed up in flooded parts of the country that also suffer from deforestation, the damage is thought to have been compounded by the felling of trees that could have soaked up water and stabilised the soil. The attorney general’s office is leading a task force to check if illegal activities contributed to the disaster, according to local media. Reuters also reported that the environment ministry planned to query logging, mining and palm plantation companies about their activities.

Sonia Seneviratne, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich and a co-author of the latest IPCC report, said other human factors may have amplified the extent of the floods, but that did not contradict the role of climate change in worsening rainfall.

“We have a very clear signal of increases in heavy precipitation with increasing warming, both on a global scale and in Asia,” she said. “The influence of human-induced climate change on the intensification of heavy precipitation is well established, and this is a key element in the reported floodings.”

The sliver of good news in the longer term is that the human cost of floods and storms has dropped sharply around the world as governments have set up early warning systems and got used to shepherding people out of danger before a disaster strikes. Even in middle-income countries that have made great progress in turning death tolls into displacement figures, however, experts say response systems are still patchy.

“The picture in south-east Asia shows that you still need even better early warning systems, even better shelter for people to go to in times of flooding … [and] even more nature-based solutions – the planting of trees and mangroves in those places particularly at risk of flooding to keep people safer,” said Alexander Matheou, the director of the Asia-Pacific region for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

People also need “better social protection systems in disasters so they can immediately get cash and the food, medicine, and shelter they need when a disaster strikes”, he said.

That would be China’s biggest diplomatic **outpost** in the world. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that **consolidating** China’s seven existing diplomatic sites in London into a single embassy “clearly brings security advantages”.

In a speech on Monday night, he argued that the government could not continue to **blow “hot and cold”** on China and needed to strike a balance.

He described China as a “nation of immense scale, ambition and **ingenuity**” and “a **defining** force in technology, in trade and global governance”.

“Our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by **illusion**. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and **sober** realism,” Starmer said.

Yvette Cooper said their departments had “carefully considered the **breadth** of considerations” related to the proposed embassy.

“We discussed the **essence** of what is embedded in these American documents.”

“The president also did not hide our **critical** and even negative attitude towards a number of proposals.”

He added that the US hoped a compromise would allow them “not just to rebuild their economy, but to **prosper** as a country”.

The relatively **downbeat** assessments of Tuesday night’s diplomacy follows combative opening statements from Putin.

The US delegation was in an intense round of **shuttle** diplomacy that the Trump administration has claimed is its best chance yet of bringing an end to the war.

A short video **feed** from the Kremlin showed the two small delegations sitting on opposite sides of an oval white table.

He has also demanded clear, **enforceable** security guarantees from the west to prevent a future Russian invasion.

Putin’s comments appeared aimed at driving a **wedge** between Washington and European capitals.

**Buoyed** up by recent gains at the front, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy **faltered**.

The Russian president threatened that Moscow would “step up strikes on Ukrainian ports and on any ships entering them” in response to attacks on Russian tankers, which he described as “**piracy**”.
