#### Lesson 26

一般现在时：经常发生的事情。

- I am having breakfast. Do you always get up so late?

- The earth goes round the sun.

一些动词告诉我们经常发生的事情，它们很少用于进行时态。包括：appear、appreciate、believe、feel、forget、hear、know、like、look like、notice、remember、resemble、see、think、understand。

引号的使用：

- 引号应在句尾其他标点符号——如逗号、句号、问号之外。
  
  如：'It's a new one. Do you like it?'

- 在 said、asked 等词后用逗号，只有当它们位于句尾时，才在它们的后面用句号。
  
  如：She said, 'but isn't it upside down?' / 'What are you doing?' she asked.

- 当 said、asked 等词置于引语之间时，句子的后半部分以小写字母开始。（见上句）

- 当一个新的说话人开始讲话时，要另起一个段落。

词汇：

- This curtain material is very good **cloth**.（布料）

- The book (which) you lent me is not very interesting.

such 后跟名词，so 后跟形容词。

- **By the end of next year**, they will have finished work on the new stadium.（今年年底前）

将来进行时与一般将来时的区别：将来进行时强调动作在将来特定时间正在发生的情况，而不是仅仅表明这个动作将会发生。以下情形通常需要使用将来进行时而非一般将来时：

- 预定或计划好的未来事件：描述一个在未来某一特定时间肯定会发生的事情，并且这件事情通常是事先安排好的。
  
  如：This time tomorrow, I will be flying to Japan.

- 礼貌询问或讨论未来的安排：将来进行时是更为委婉的表达方式。
  
  如：Will you be joining us for dinner tonight?

  如：Next summer, we will be living in Spain for three months.

#### Lesson 38

no sooner ... than ... 表示"一......就......"，用来引导时间状语从句。主句用过去完成时，从句用一般过去式。

#### Lesson 40

用将来进行时来提问，会显得比一般将来时更加委婉客气，是一种不想迫使对方做出明确答复的语气。

not only ... but ... as well 用在否定句时，将 as well 替换成 either。

- She **not only** refused to answer any questions **but** did not ask any questions **either**.

非真实条件句：if 从句谈论想象的情况，主句则推测想象的结果。此时，需要在从句中用动词的过去式，这并不表示过去的动作，而是被称作“非真实的过去”。如果 if 从句中的动词是 be，则总是使用 were，无论主语的人称或单复数是何种情况。
