### US and Trump

#### [2025-03-26 Republican senators break ranks to call for investigation of Signal leak scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/signal-investigation-republican-senators)

Senior national security officials testified before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday, where the national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, and CIA director, John Ratcliffe, were **grilled** by lawmakers over the scandal.

However, he did not describe how the leak happened and **trashed** Goldberg, calling him “the bottom-scum of journalists”.

#### [2025-04-05 Trump tariffs come into effect in ‘seismic’ shift to global trade](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/trump-tariffs-come-into-effect-in-seismic-shift-to-global-trade)

Shaw said: “This is a pretty **seismic** and significant shift in the way that we trade with every country on Earth.”

#### [2025-05-18 US treasury secretary says Walmart will ‘eat some of the tariffs’ after Trump demand](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/18/trump-walmart-tariffs)

The statement provoked an angry response from Trump, who posted a **rant** to his Truth Social network on Saturday saying the company should “eat the tariffs and not charge valued customers anything”.

On Thursday, McMillon said in the earnings call that his company, a **bellwether** of US consumer health, was moving to protect itself against the impacts of Trump’s tariffs, despite the president’s administration announcing a pause in its trade war with China that analysts called “capitulation day”.

For too long, he said, the US had been “looted, **pillaged**, raped and **plundered** by nations near and far”, and he presented a list of countries and territories that would receive tariffs, ranging from numerous US allies and longtime trade partners to **barren**, remote islands near **Antarctica** occupied only by penguins.

He has since attempted to walk back many of the **excesses** of the policy, including this week’s announcement that, for an initial 90-day period, tariffs on China – a dominant supplier to Walmart and **myriad** other US companies – would be cut from 145% to 30%.

#### [2025-06-05 Impeachment, Epstein and bitter acrimony: Trump and Musk joust in astonishing social media duel](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/trump-elon-musk-fallout)

The deterioration of their once close relationship into bitter **acrimony** came over the course of several remarkable hours during which the president and the world’s richest person **hurled** deeply personal insults over matters significant and insignificant.

In the most **churlish** moment of the astonishing saga, Musk said on X the reason the Trump administration had not released the files into Epstein was because they **implicated** the president. He later quote-tweeted a post calling for Trump to be removed and said Trump’s tariffs would cause a recession.

For weeks, Musk has complained about the budget bill, and used the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimating the bill would add $2.4tn to the deficit over the next decade as an opening to condemn the legislation as a “disgusting **abomination**”.

On Thursday, Trump appeared to finally have had enough of Musk’s complaints. Speaking in the Oval Office as the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, looked on in **bemusement**, Trump mocked Musk’s recent black eye and questioned why he didn’t cover it up.

But then Trump posted on Truth Social that he had fired Musk from his role as a special adviser because he was “**wearing thin**” at the White House, and Musk responded: “Such an obvious lie. So sad.”

Musk spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Trump’s re-election campaign through his specially created America Pac, which **shouldered** a large portion of Trump’s door-knocking campaign, although the actual impact of that ground-game effort is unclear.

#### [2025-06-08 Newsom is warned of ‘criminal tax evasion’ if he withholds federal taxes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/08/newsom-warned-tax-evasion)

The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has warned California governor Gavin Newsom that he would be guilty of “criminal tax evasion” if he **withholds** his state’s tax payments to the federal government amid threats of a funding cut by Donald Trump.

In a statement on Friday, the White House spokesperson Kush Desai criticized California’s energy, immigration and other positions as “lunatic anti-energy, soft-on-crime, pro-child **mutilation**, and pro-**sanctuary** policies”.

“No taxpayer should be forced to fund the **demise** of our country,” Desai said.

Soon before Newsom made his threat, California assembly speaker Robert Rivas described the rumored grant cancellations as “unconstitutional and **vindictive**.”

#### [2025-06-10 Protests across US as anger grows over Trump’s immigration crackdown](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/us-protests-immigration-trump)

Shirley, a 29-year-old protester, condemned the Trump administration for targeting workers, which she called **antithetical** to the country’s **essence**.

After a rally, the protesters **barricaded** driveways with e-bikes and e-scooters to block homeland security vehicles thought to be transporting detained immigrants.

### Japan and South Korean

#### [2025-04-22 Rice crisis: Japan imports grain from South Korea for first time in more than 25 years](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/japan-south-korea-rice-import-crisis)

“I have no **qualms** about eating imported rice. Prices have gone up, so I’m always looking for cheaper options.”

The trend has forced the Japanese government to take the unusual step of **dipping** into its vast rice reserves.

Japan’s rice stockpiles had already **depleted** after record-breaking temperatures affected the 2023 crop.

#### [2025-05-01 Snake on a train line: Japan’s busiest bullet train route brought to a halt](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/japan-snake-bullet-train)

The **outage** happened at 5.25pm between Maibara and Gifu-Hashima stations.

It has an **exemplary** safety record, with not a single injury or accident recorded, and trains running to within an average of 1.6 minutes of their scheduled times, according to operator Central Japan Railway Co. (JR Tokai).

A 40cm snake inside a **carriage** on a Nagoya to Tokyo service in April last year caused **consternation** among passengers. Staff were unable to find the creature, and the carriage was replaced, resulting in a 17-minute delay.

#### [2025-05-01 Japanese police arrest man after alleged car attack on schoolchildren, say reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/man-arrested-in-japan-after-allegedly-driving-a-car-into-schoolchildren-say-reports)

A mother in her 20s who had come to pick up her son, and who saw the attack, told NHK: “The car was being driven **erratically**, and it seems that it continued to move forward even after it had hit the children.

“He was very quiet and appeared to be in a **daze**.”

#### [2025-05-19 Runaway rice prices spell danger for Japan’s prime minister as elections loom](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/19/runaway-rice-prices-spell-danger-for-japans-prime-minister-as-elections-loom)

Attempts to bring down the price of the Japanese **staple** have had little effect, prompting calls for a reduction in the consumption (sales) tax to ease the cost-of-living crisis.

Approval ratings for Ishiba’s cabinet stand at 27.4%, according to the poll, the lowest since he took office last October and a **dip** of more than five percentage points in the past month, Kyodo said.

In March it began releasing stockpiled rice in an attempt to arrest price rises that have been blamed on a combination of factors, including higher demand fuelled in part by the tourism boom, distribution bottlenecks, and suspected **hoarding** by wholesalers and distributors in anticipation of further shortages.

But the move, which is usually reserved for shortages caused by natural disasters and crop failures, did not have the desired effect, with prices of domestic rice falling only **marginally**.

#### [2025-05-21 Japanese minister resigns after saying he doesn’t buy rice because he gets it free](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/21/japan-farm-minister-resigns-rice-price)

But speaking at a **fundraiser** last weekend, Etō said he had “never bought rice myself because my supporters donate so much to me that I can **practically** sell it”.

Etō’s comment **incensed** consumers, who are having to pay nearly double for a bag of rice compared with a year ago, according to figures published in April.

“I asked myself whether it is appropriate for me to stay at the **helm** of the agriculture ministry at a critical time for rice prices, and I concluded that it is not,” Etō added, according to the Kyodo news agency.

#### [2025-05-28 Fukushima soil headed to Japan PM’s flower beds to allay nuclear safety fears](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/28/fukushima-radioactive-soil-japan-pm-garden)

It would be used as foundation material and covered with topsoil thick enough to keep radiation at **negligible** levels.

Work to remove 880 tonnes of highly dangerous damaged fuel from reactor **containment** **vessels** has barely begun.

The plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, has also had to **contend** with huge quantities of water that becomes **contaminated** when it is used to cool the damaged reactors.

The removal of topsoil, trees and other debris from near homes, schools, medical facilities and other public buildings created a stockpile of contaminated waste that now fills a site **straddling** the towns of Futaba and Okuma, located close to the plant.

In its final report on the recycling and **disposal** of the soil last year, the International Atomic Energy Agency said the work had been consistent with its safety standards.

But the public is yet to be convinced. Last month, local opposition forced the environment ministry to abandon a pilot project to use some of the Fukushima soil as **landfill** for flower beds and lawns at public parks in and around Tokyo.

#### [2025-06-05 Japan records lowest number of births in more than a century, as population fears grow](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/05/japan-records-lowest-number-of-births-in-more-than-a-century-as-population-fears-grow)

The number of marriages – a key factor in influencing birth trends in a country where relatively few children are born out of **wedlock** – rose for the first time in two years to 485,063, up by 10,322 from a year earlier. But the downward trend seen since the 1970s remains unchanged.

The prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, who has described Japan’s demographics as a “silent emergency”, recently unveiled measures to boost the birthrate, including an expansion of child **allowance** and free high school education, and a guarantee that couples will receive the equivalent of 100% of their take-home pay when they take parental leave at the same time.

#### [2025-07-04 Japan walks line between recession and submission as it seeks to overcome Trump tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/04/japan-submission-recession-trump-tariffs)

But the backdrop to the offending photo was far more significant than the uncomfortable **optics**.

Akazawa’s trade delegation was in Washington to begin tariff negotiations with its American counterparts that officials in Tokyo were initially optimistic would end with Japan’s exemption from Trump’s most **egregious** protectionist instincts.

Eleven weeks and seven rounds of talks later, Japan and the US have reached an impasse, with Trump unleashing on his country’s most important ally in the Asia-Pacific the kind of **invective** he once reserved for China and the European Union: “They won’t take our RICE, and yet they have a massive rice shortage,” he wrote online, adding it showed “how **spoiled** countries have become”.

The friction is beginning to **seep** into other parts of the bilateral relationship, with Tokyo and Washington at odds, to varying degrees, on the cost of hosting American troops in Japan and recent attacks by the US and Israel on Iran.

To add insult to injury, the **chasm** that has opened up between Tokyo and Washington on trade came as the US agreed to slash reciprocal tariffs on Vietnamese imports from 46% to 20%.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, he floated the idea of raising tariffs on imports from Japan to 30% or 35%, and **bemoaned** its consumers’ lack of enthusiasm for American cars and rice.

That will not put the brakes on Trump’s mission to **hack away** at Japan’s $68bn trade surplus with the US – hence his recent demands that it increase imports of US oil and other goods.

The **trade row** has landed Ishiba and his government in a predicament every bit as sticky as the early-summer heat and humidity blanketing Japan.

Battered by funding scandals, soaring rice prices and a cost-of-living crisis, Ishiba’s administration is **limping** into the campaign for upper house elections on 20 July, nine months after his Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner lost their majority in the lower house.

Any **inkling** that Tokyo is prepared to bend to Trump’s demands will not go down well with voters, while analysts warn that the economic impact of accepting higher tariffs could push the Japanese economy – the world’s fifth biggest – into recession.

Tariffs, though, are putting strain on what the former US ambassador to Tokyo, Mike Mansfield, once described as the “most important bilateral relationship in the world, **bar none**”.

Japan also declined to offer **full-throated** support for the US attacks on Iran, saying only that it “understood” Washington’s determination to halt Tehran’s nuclear weapons programme.

This week, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, **called off** his first visit to Japan and South Korea, saying he was needed in Washington for talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

#### [2025-07-20 Japan PM Shigeru Ishiba vows to stay on despite losing upper house majority](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/20/apan-pm-election-result-exit-polls-predict-loss-of-upper-house)

Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba’s has vowed to stay on despite his **coalition** losing its upper house majority in elections that saw strong gains by a rightwing **populist** party.

Ishiba told a news conference he would remain in office to oversee tariff talks with the United States and other **pressing** matters such as rising consumer prices that are straining the world’s fourth largest economy.

But the result also weakens Ishiba’s position just days before the country needs to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration to **avert** the imposition of punishing tariffs in its largest export market.

Japanese imports are already subject to a 10% tariff, while the auto industry – which accounts for 8% of jobs – is **reeling from** a 25% levy.

Weak export data last week, which showed plummeting US-bound auto deliveries, **stoked** fears that Japan could tip into a technical recession.

The LDP has been urging for fiscal restraint, with one eye on a very **jittery** government bond market, as investors worry about Japan’s ability to refinance the world’s largest debt pile.

Sanseito, which first emerged during the Covid pandemic spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations and a **cabal** of global elites, has dragged once fringe political rhetoric into the mainstream and gained wider support among frustrated voters.

#### [2025-07-25 ‘Japanese First’: breakthrough by rightwing populists sparks fears of anti-foreigner backlash in Japan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/25/japan-upper-house-election-sanseito-japanese-first)

Sanseito’s new **contingent** of 14 upper house lawmakers, up from a single seat in the previous election, is undoubtedly a breakthrough, but still leaves it a minor force in the 248-seat chamber.

“I think that leads to things like patriotism and **xenophobia**.”

But as its GDP growth **stagnated** and neighbours such as China and South Korea began to leave it behind in sectors from electronics to shipbuilding, he suggests Japan has struggled to adjust to its new reality.

Reports of crimes by foreigners, often circulated on social media, have also raised **hackles**, even though police statistics show immigrants commit proportionally fewer offences than the native population.

He sees the **electorate**’s main concerns as the economy and the sales tax, which Sanseito promised to cut.

“So, in order to protect their emotional wellbeing and maintain their sense of self-worth, people **cling** to the idea that Japanese culture is the best.”

#### [2025-06-03 Lee Jae-myung wins election as South Korean president](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/03/lee-jae-myung-elected-as-south-korean-president-exit-polls-say)

================================================================================================================================================

Liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung has won the vote to become South Korea’s new president after a **snap election** triggered by a brief period of martial law imposed by the now-impeached former leader, Yoon Suk Yeol.

Kim, a former labour minister under Yoon, warned that a **victorious** Lee would abuse his powers to retaliate against his political opponents and use his party’s majority in the national assembly to protect him in several court cases that will resume after the election.
