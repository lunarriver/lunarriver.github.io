#### [Nepal prime minister quits after deaths at protests sparked by social media ban | Nepal | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/09/nepal-protests-social-media-ban-lifted-gen-z-kathmandu)

Nepal’s prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, has resigned after some of the worst unrest in decades rocked the country this week, set off by a ban on social media and **discontentment** at political corruption and **nepotism**.

The government decision to roll back the ban on sites such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and X late on Monday night did nothing to **quell** the anger among young people, who continued what was called the “Gen Z” protests.

In defiance of **curfews**, protests continued to erupt across the country on Tuesday and thousands stormed the federal parliament building in the capital, Kathmandu, and set it on fire. Car **tyres** were burned in the streets of Kathmandu and riot police were **pelted** with stones.

```

```

As calls for the resignation of Oli grew on Tuesday, his home was set **alight**, while homes of other prominent ministers and leaders and political offices were also attacked.

“Our prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, is extremely authoritarian and **egoistic**. As the guardian of the nation, he failed to stand on the side of the nation’s children. Now the entire generation will come after them.”

Amnesty International said live **ammunition** had been used against protesters on Monday, and the United Nations demanded a swift and transparent inquiry.

The ban on social media came after Nepal’s government gave social media firms a seven-day deadline to register under new regulations, including to establish a point of contact and **designate** resident grievance and compliance officers.

“The social media ban was not the only agenda of the Gen Z movement. The corruption that has **permeated** every level of the country must end,” said Raksha Bam, 26. “But instead of stopping that corruption, they shut down the civic space of our generation. That is why Gen Z gathered in one place.”

The Order of Courage, a **prestigious** state decoration, was given to him “for courage, bravery and **dedication** displayed in the fulfilment of military duty”, according to a decree published on Russia’s official legal acts website late on Monday.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s **chief of staff**, Andriy Yermak, said he discussed Sunday’s attack – the first of its kind in the war – with US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Monday.

While visiting the building, the European Union’s ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova, noted the “**gaping** hole” left by the impact and missile **remnants** and said: “It’s only because the missile was unable to fully **detonate** that the entire building wasn’t turned into ruins.”

The investigation found that more than 10 members of Infidels MC, a US biker gang that uses the **Crusader** cross as its symbol and whose members have anti-Islamic **tattoos**, have been hired by UG Solutions and deployed to food aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

Mulford, whose **affiliation** with GHF was public, accidentally sent an email to the BBC telling other leaders of the group not to comment on inquiries – inadvertently revealing the identities of several other senior **Infidels** members also working for UG Solutions.

GHF’s operations have come under scrutiny as the US and Israeli-backed group has **supplanted** nearly every other major humanitarian organisation working in the Gaza Strip in what critics have called a deliberate effort to politicise humanitarian aid.

“We do not **screen** for personal hobbies or affiliations unrelated to job performance or security standards.”

In a statement to the Guardian, GHF said: “The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy toward any form of hateful or **discriminatory** behavior.”

Netanyahu has responded **defiantly** to international criticism for the attack, including a White House statement that the “unilateral bombing” inside Qatar “does not advance Israel or America’s goals.”

Hamas said in a statement that all of its leaders were safe, but five lower-ranked members were reportedly killed. A senior Israeli official admitted on Wednesday that optimism about the success of the strikes was **waning**.

“Why does the prime minister insist on blowing up every small chance for a deal? Why? The people of Israel are tired of this war. End it **already** and bring everyone back,” said Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan was kidnapped from his **kibbutz**.

Successive polls have shown broad support in Israel for a deal to end the war and free the hostages, while Netanyahu has been accused of prolonging the conflict for political **ends**.

“In Israel … the vast majority of the people now are in favour of ending the war and bringing back the hostages … So that might look like the concluding **remarks** of the war,” Nadan said.

Meanwhile in Sana’a, people said Wednesday’s attack had struck a **hideout** between two mountains that was used as a command-and-control headquarters. The extent of any damage was not immediately clear.

Ukraine had presented proposals for joint protection of European airspace “in a coordinated, **well-thought-out**, joint way …

The UK will **mass** produce low-cost Ukrainian-designed interceptor drones to help Ukraine fight off Russian UAV attacks.

Indian buyers are demanding bigger discounts on Russian crude oil because of the risk posed by dodging the international price cap, oil industry analysts have told Reuters – with some Russian sellers responding by saying they will send oil **cargoes** to China instead.

The EU has lowered the price cap for Russian oil from October to 47.60 a **barrel**, down from 60. Richard Bronze is the head of geopolitics at **consultancy** Energy Aspects. The EU was considering a faster **phase-out** of Russian fossil fuels as part of new sanctions.

The emerging details came as several senators, Democrats and some Republicans, indicated dissatisfaction with the administration’s **rationale** and questioned the legality of the action.

“Our armed forces are not law enforcement agencies,” said Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a floor speech this week.

Kelly also said Nicolás Maduro was not the legitimate president of Venezuela and that he was a “**fugitive**”.

An emergency session of the UN security council will convene on Friday at Poland’s request as **Warsaw** seeks to rally support after the Russian drone incursion, write Shaun Walker and Jakub Krupa.

Poland’s PM, Donald Tusk, announced the closure on Tuesday because of the “very aggressive” Zapad military exercises being conducted by Belarus and Russia as well as a growing number of provocations from the **dictatorial** allies.

Thousands gathered at the **Slovak** capital, **Bratislava**, on Thursday, in part to protest about last week’s meeting between their pro-Putin prime minister, Robert Fico, and the Russian president in Beijing.

He added: “We can continue to **humanise** the people involved in this war and what they are going through. I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it’s easy to become **desensitised** to what has been going on.”

The prince said he was initially invited to Kyiv by Olga Rudnieva, the founder and CEO of the Superhumans Trauma Centre in Lviv, Ukraine which treats wounded **amputees**.

“I **bumped** into Olga in New York."

“It was **remarkable**. Everyone felt an **immense** connection to them.”

However analysts suggested it was also designed to **placate** Donald Trump, who has been pressuring Mexico not to act as a “back door” for Chinese goods into the US.

On Thursday, China’s ministry of foreign affairs said Beijing “firmly rejects moves that are taken under coercion to constrain China or undermine China’s legitimate rights and interests under any **pretext**”.

“We will firmly protect our rights and interests **in light of** the developments of the situation,” foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular briefing.

Trump’s tariff regime has **upended** ties and alliances around the world – having moved beyond its original stated purpose of rebalancing trade relationships in the US’s favour, to being **wielded** as a geopolitical tool.

The supreme court is set to hear Trump’s appeal against that **verdict** in the first week of November and the tariffs remain in place ahead of its ruling.

#### [US and China reach deal to transfer TikTok ownership, trade officials say | TikTok | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/15/trump-china-tiktok-sale-ban)

“We would like to stress that the outcomes of the trade and economic consultations are **hard won**” Li said in Madrid.

The Department of Justice last year said TikTok had gathered the sensitive data of American users based off gun control, **abortion** and religion through its use of Lark, a workplace communication platform similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams, according to court documents.

Security experts have long pointed to three main areas of concern: Chinese influence campaigns, mass data collection on US citizens, and potential vulnerabilities that could **compromise** users’ devices.

The TikTok ownership saga stretches back to 2020, when Trump first ordered ByteDance to **divest** TikTok or face a shutdown. Microsoft initially pursued a potential **acquisition** worth billions of dollars, with CEO Satya Nadella engaging directly with Trump, but it fell apart in what Nadella dubbed at the time “the strangest deal” he has ever worked on.

Soon after, Walmart and Oracle came close to buying TikTok’s US **arm**, proposing a joint acquisition of a new entity called TikTok Global, but it was shelved indefinitely after the Biden administration conducted its own review of Chinese tech companies.

“We’re not going to be in the business of having **repetitive** extensions,” Greer said. “We have a deal.”

#### [Chinese economy slows amid Trump trade war and weaker consumer spending | Chinese economy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/chinese-economy-weakens-as-consumer-spending-and-factory-output-slows)

The disappointing data adds pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus to fend off a sharp slowdown, with a debt crisis denting the country’s once-booming property sector and exports facing stronger **headwinds**.

A spokesperson for China’s statistics bureau said on Monday that more efforts were needed to support China’s **ailing** property sector and that the “external environment is very severe”.

Although the two countries agreed a pause on tariffs until 10 November, China recorded a **slump** in US-bound exports last month.

“The activity data point to a further loss of **momentum**,” Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.

Authorities are leaning on manufacturers to find new markets to **offset** Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies and weak consumer spending.

“Policies and measures to support service consumption are expected to offset the impact of **aggregate** demand this month,” he said.

```

“We will not **relent** until the mission is completed.”

They estimated that the invading force would be met by up to 3,000 Hamas and **allied** fighters, and said the Israeli forces would advance cautiously.

“This phase is defined by a coordinated and gradual manoeuvre combining precise intelligence, air and ground forces targeting Hamas’s central stronghold and aimed at dismantling its **grip** in this area.”

“It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the **criteria** set forth in the genocide convention,” said Navi Pillay.

suspend ~ verb ~ to stop something from being active, either temporarily or permanently

“**Suspending** trade concessions and imposing sanctions on extremist ministers and violent settlers would clearly signal that the EU demands an end to this war,” she said.

Netanyahu sought to brace the country for greater economic isolation in a speech on Monday in which he said it would have to “adapt to an economy with **autarkic** features”, suggesting it would have to be more self-reliant with fewer trade options.

Tess Ingram, a spokesperson for the UN child protection agency, Unicef, said there was no safe **haven** for the displaced population.

“It is inhumane to expect nearly half a million children, battered and **traumatised** by over 700 days of unrelenting conflict, to flee one **hellscape** and end up in another.”.

But that certainty shifted slightly this month when the threat **catapulted** into the headlines, as Beijing used a military parade commemorating Japan’s defeat in the second world war to unveil a range of new military hardware – including a weapon dubbed the “Guam Killer” by Chinese media.

For that reason, displays of China’s increasing military **prowess** – this month’s event included nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles, anti-drone **lasers** and four-legged “robot wolves” – **loom** large in the territory.

“Guam should be aware of the threat, even if not so worried,” says Col Grant Newsham, a retired US marine officer, noting that the Chinese military has **outpace** the US in some areas.

“That can alter regional and global diplomacy and make coordinated actions more likely. It’s alarming because it can be a military and security **allegiance**,” Reilly says.

Local officials, however, continue to insist that defending Guam is of **paramount** importance to the US military.

Von der Leyen announced the commission would soon present its 19th package of sanctions aimed at Russia’s war effort – targeting **crypto**, banks, and energy.

Europe has in fact greatly reduced its purchase of Russian oil and gas, though two big **holdouts** are Hungary and Slovakia, whose rightwing prime ministers are both friendly with Putin and Trump.

The editorial listed how Trump’s promises and threats concerning the Ukraine war have all failed to produce results – including how “an 8 August deadline for Mr Putin to agree to a ceasefire somehow **morphed** into a red carpet welcome in Alaska”.

A Russian drone, missile or **glide** bomb hit an educational building in Kharkiv city’s southern Slobidskyi district on Tuesday. Some reports described the building as the pharmaceutical university.

A Ukrainian arrested in Italy last month over the 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines from Russia to Europe must be **extradited** to Germany, a court in Bologna ruled on Tuesday. The man, identified as Serhii K, has denied taking part and will appeal against his **extradition** to Italy’s supreme court, his lawyer said.

Meanwhile the EU is **grappling** with demands from Trump to impose up to 100% tariffs on India and China, another buyer of Russian oil, to pressure Russia to end the war.

But privately, officials have **balked** at 100% tariffs, at a time when Brussels is also trying to sign a trade agreement with India by the end of the year.

Asked about the link between the trade talks and India’s relations with Russia, Kallas said: “Negotiations are negotiations and until we agree about everything then nothing is agreed.” She added that the EU had to take into account its interests, concerns and “**problematic** issues”.

But he was also **downbeat** about the latest round of trade talks, saying he had hoped to see more progress in meetings last week.

The commission is **racing** to strike trade deals around the world since Trump hit many European goods with tariffs and pressured the EU into an unequal trade agreement.

He said that a commitment to the 2026 deadline would “establish a clear timeline, and demonstrate our resolve to achieve independence from oil supplies **burdened** with political and strategic risks”.

At a press conference in Madrid, the deputy head of China’s cyber security **regulator** said the framework of the deal included “**licensing** the algorithm and other intellectual property rights”.

Wang Jingtao said ByteDance would “**entrust** the operation of TikTok’s US user data and content security.”

Some commentators have inferred from these comments that TikTok’s US **spinoff** will retain the Chinese algorithm.

At arguments in the Supreme Court in January, a lawyer for TikTok ByteDance told the justices how difficult it would be to sell the platform to a US company, because Chinese law restricts the sale of the **proprietary** algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful.

American officials have previously warned the algorithm that **fuels** what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect.

“It wouldn’t be in **compliance** if the algorithm is Chinese. There can’t be any shared algorithm with ByteDance,” said a spokesperson for the House Select Committee on China.

```

The controversies reveal the increasingly **precarious** position of influential religious leaders in China, as the official support for the commercialisation of religious sites gives way to an emphasis on **frugality** and political **obedience**.

Wu is accused of **soliciting** public donations under the guise of collecting money for unmarried pregnant women and needy children, which was actually spent on personal **extravagances**.

```

In August, a video of monks from Hangzhou’s Lingyin Temple sitting around a table counting **wads** of cash went viral, catapulting the 4th century hall of **worship** into a social media storm.

In **medieval** times, monasteries stood in for banks, loaning cash to **merchants** while charging high interest rates.

The **opprobrium** comes from ordinary people who see riches as being spiritually **corrosive**, and, increasingly, from the government, which under the leadership of Xi Jinping has cracked down on excess wealth and corruption.

```
wad ~ noun ~ a number of usually flat and/or small objects pressed tightly together

worship ~ noun ~ the act of worshipping God or a god, often through praying or singing

But as China entered a period of economic reform and opening up in the 1980s, temples were back in **vogue**, with many turning to tourism to support themselves, often with explicit government support.

Gift shops selling Shaolin-branded **merchandise** also opened, and Shaolin **Inc** was born.

Over the years he took a **troupe** of **martial** arts monks to Moscow for a special performance at the invitation of Vladimir Putin. It led one worker near the Shaolin monastery to remark that the political **heft** of local CCP officials seemed **paltry** in comparison with Shi.

```
vogue ~ noun ~ a fashion or general liking, especially one that is temporary

merchandise ~ noun ~ goods that are bought and sold

troupe ~ noun ~ a group of performers such as singers or dancers who work and travel together

martial ~ adjective ~ relating to soldiers, war, or life in the armed forces

heft ~ noun ~ the weight of something

paltry ~ adjective ~ (of an amount of money) very small and of little or no value
```

As China suffers with **stubbornly** sluggish economic growth, temples in theory are a gift to both local governments and ordinary people. The authorities benefit from increased domestic spending as people flock to temple-**cum**-tourist attractions, while people struggling to find work or fulfilment in Chinese society are increasingly turning to religion for spiritual guidance.

But temples also must **tread** an increasingly narrow line between popularity and political obedience.

“It’s almost always that there is something else going on that has to do with **patronage**,” says Ian Johnson, the author of The Souls of China, a book about religion in China.

Xi has shown a particular interest in traditional Chinese religions. Early in his career he helped to re-open important Buddhist temples and turn them into tourist attractions, a blueprint for how the officially **atheist** Party could work with religion.

```
stubbornly ~ adverb ~ in a way that shows you are determined to do what you want and refuse to do anything else

tread ~ verb ~ to put your foot on something or to press something down with your foot

patronage ~ noun ~ the support given to an organization by someone

atheist ~ noun ~ someone who does not believe in any god or gods, or who believes that no god or gods exist
```

Now it seems that the Shaolin monastery, set in the **jagged** Song mountain range, is being brought to heel. He **halted** commercial performances, banned expensive **consecration** rituals, said he would remove temple shops and said that he would eliminate other unpopular fees.

But so far, the anti-commercialisation drive is **patchy** at best. Yellow-robed monks stage daily, **spellbinding** martial arts that are free – for anyone who has bought an 80 yuan ticket to the temple complex.

It would not have been known internationally … there are **pros and cons**.

“After all, I’d also want to drive a range **rover**”.

```
jagged ~ adjective ~ rough and with sharp points

The leadership of the Palestinian Authority is **subject to** elections within a year.

The UK prime minister said recognition was “part of that overall package which hopefully takes us from the **appalling** situation we’re in now to the outcome of a safe and secure Israel, which we do not have, and a viable Palestinian state”.

The UK Foreign Office had long **parried** calls for recognition, saying the step should only be taken when it had maximum impact on the peace process.

These included a resumption of humanitarian aid, a ceasefire, Israeli engagement in a **sustained** peace process, and no further Israeli land annexations in the West Bank.

The Czech president, Petr Pavel, has said Nato must respond **adequately** to Russian airspace violations, including potentially by shooting down Russian jets. Unfortunately, this is **teetering** on the edge of conflict, but giving in to evil is simply not an option.” 

British fighter jets have flown their first Nato air defence sortie over Poland as part of the Eastern **Sentry** mission following Russian drone incursions.

The general staff added that Ukrainian special forces struck a production and transit station in Samara for the export-grade **Urals** oil that **comprises** up to 50% of the total volume of Russian exports.

Trump has threatened sanctions but then **backtracked** to say he will do it only after all Nato countries agree to stop buying oil from Russia and put tariffs on China, another big importer of Russia’s oil. 

At least three people were killed when a missile carrying **cluster munitions** struck an apartment building in the city of Dnipro.

The special **rapporteur** on rights in Russia, Mariana Katzarova, denounces in her report “the continuing widespread and systematic recourse to torture and ill-treatment by Russian law enforcement officials, security forces, **penitentiary** officials and members of the armed forces”.

#### [UK, Canada and Australia announce formal recognition of Palestine, with wave of Israel’s allies to follow | Palestinian territories | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/uk-canada-and-australia-announce-formal-recognition-of-palestine-with-wave-of-israel-allies-to-follow)

A wave of Israel’s allies are announcing their recognition of the state of Palestine, as part of a wider manoeuvre designed to **ostracise** Hamas and challenge attempts by the Israeli government to erase the chance of a Palestinian homeland.

The UK, Canada and Australia formally declared their recognition of Palestinian **statehood** on Sunday in separate but coordinated statements.

The delicate and partly symbolic move by as many 10 states, **pioneered** largely by the French government, has the potential to lead to a negative spiral of further confrontation.

The declarations with various conditions and **emphases** attached reflect the conflicting domestic pressures on governments as they face a backlash from Israel, and from hostage families that claim the move effectively rewards Hamas for its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.

At the centre of the French plan, now fully endorsed by Arab states, is to make recognition part of a wider process, including a reformed, democratically elected Palestinian Authority that in the event of a ceasefire comes to **supersede** a disarmed and dismantled Hamas in Gaza.

Macron, identified by Israel as the **galvanising** force behind the surge in recognitions, went on Israel’s Channel 12 to warn “the approach of your government and some ministers especially is to destroy the possibility of a two-state solution.”

```
ostracise ~ verb ~ to avoid someone intentionally, or to prevent someone from taking part in the activities of a group

statehood ~ noun ~ the condition of being a country or a part of a large country that has its own government

pioneer ~ verb ~ a person who is one of the first people to do something

supersede ~ verb ~ to replace something, especially something older or more old-fashioned

galvanise ~ verb ~ to cause someone to suddenly take action, especially by shocking or exciting them in some way
```

He insisted recognition was not a reward for Hamas, since the terrorist group wanted an Islamic state and the destruction of Israel, something a two-state solution would **preclude**.

The US state department has tried to block Abbas from speaking from the **rostrum** at the UN in New York by denying US visas to the PA, a move that triggered a 145 to five vote at the UN general assembly to allow him to speak via a video link.

But the French argue the move has already brought concessions by Abbas on **deradicalisation**, and his **denunciation** of the 7 October attack as a terrorist act.

His proposals have been **roundly** rejected by Netanyahu.

The **quartet** are rallying countries around an emergency aid package to prevent the collapse of the PA.

```
preclude ~ verb ~ to prevent something or make it impossible, or prevent someone from doing something

rostrum ~ noun ~ a raised surface on which a person making a speech or a music conductor (= leader) stands

In 1914 when the first world war began, the Ottoman empire threw in its **lot** with the **central powers** and Britain’s response was to declare Egypt a British protectorate. The following April, the members of the triple **entente** – France, Russia and Great Britain – started to secretly negotiate backroom plans for the Middle East on the assumption that the Ottoman empire would collapse.

Between 1915 and 1916, secret talks led to the Sykes-Picot agreement, a Franco-British deal fully disclosed only 20 years later, to **carve up** the Middle East.

At the same time, Arab leaders believed that in **correspondence** between Sharif Hussein, the **custodian** of the Islamic holy cities of Medina and Mecca, and Sir Harold McMahon, the high commissioner of Egypt, a clear commitment was given that Britain would support a **revolt** against the Ottomans and promote an independent Arab state covering the whole of Ottoman Asia.

In 1922, despite the promises of independence, Britain’s right to retain the mandate for Palestine was granted by the **League** of Nations and the Balfour declaration was included as part of that mandate.

In 1936 the Palestinians’ increasing frustration with the British led to open revolt, and then a brutal repression. The UK’s Peel commission decided **reluctantly** in 1937 that **partition** was the only answer, even though it would **entail** the mass displacement of Palestinians.

On the eve of the second world war in 1939, in an attempt to **mollify** both sides, a UK white paper said it favoured a Palestinian state within 10 years.

She was one of a number of independent journalists to be detained for broadcasting reports about the severe **lockdown** at **ground zero** of the pandemic.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said reports of Zhang’s rearrest and sentencing were “deeply **disturbing**”.

He said: “This is the second time Zhang has been convicted and subjected to a **custodial** sentence for this offence.”

In August 2024, she was detained and later charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, with her **indictment** citing posts on social media that “seriously damaged the country’s image”

During Zhang’s first **spell** in prison she went on hunger strike and there were reports of her being force-fed.

A freeze on North Korean nuclear weapons as “an **interim** emergency measure” would be “a **feasible**, realistic alternative” to complete denuclearisation, Lee, a liberal who favours engagement with his neighbour, told the BBC.

The prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has previously said it could be **counterproductive** to recognise the state of Palestine before it was established.

Grassroots unions across Italy called for a 24-hour general strike on Monday in solidarity with the people of Gaza, citing reasons that included the “**inertia** of the Italian and EU governments” to address the humanitarian crisis in the territory.

From Milan to Palermo, Italians poured on to the streets in at least 75 **municipalities** across the country.

Michelangelo, 17, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) he had turned up to support “a population that is being **exterminated**”.

Tensions escalated in Milan when dozens of protesters dressed in black and armed with batons tried to **smash** the main entrance of the city’s central train station.

More than 10 people were arrested in Milan and about 60 police officers suffered **bruising** or more serious injuries, according to Italy’s Ansa news agency.

Meloni has repeatedly voiced concerns about the Israeli offence but her far-right government – which has sought to **foster** close ties with Donald Trump’s administration in the US – has adopted a cautious stance on the war in Gaza.

The transport minister, Matteo Salvini, **downplayed** the impact of the protests on Monday, describing them as the “political mobilisation of far-left unionists” and praising those who had gone to work.
