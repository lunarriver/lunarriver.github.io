Nepal’s prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, has resigned after some of the worst unrest in decades rocked the country this week, set off by a ban on social media and **discontentment** at political corruption and **nepotism**.

```

The government decision to roll back the ban on sites such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and X late on Monday night did nothing to **quell** the anger among young people, who continued what was called the “Gen Z” protests.

```
quell ~ verb ~ to stop something, especially by using force
```

In defiance of **curfews**, protests continued to erupt across the country on Tuesday and thousands stormed the federal parliament building in the capital, Kathmandu, and set it on fire. Car **tyres** were burned in the streets of Kathmandu and riot police were **pelted** with stones.

```

As calls for the resignation of Oli grew on Tuesday, his home was set **alight**, while homes of other prominent ministers and leaders and political offices were also attacked.

“Our prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, is extremely authoritarian and **egoistic**. As the guardian of the nation, he failed to stand on the side of the nation’s children. Now the entire generation will come after them.”

Amnesty International said live **ammunition** had been used against protesters on Monday, and the United Nations demanded a swift and transparent inquiry.

```
ammunition ~ noun ~ objects that can be shot from a weapon, such as bullets or bombs

The ban on social media came after Nepal’s government gave social media firms a seven-day deadline to register under new regulations, including to establish a point of contact and **designate** resident grievance and compliance officers.

```
designate ~ verb ~ to choose someone officially to do a particular job
```

“The social media ban was not the only agenda of the Gen Z movement. The corruption that has **permeated** every level of the country must end,” said Raksha Bam, 26. “But instead of stopping that corruption, they shut down the civic space of our generation. That is why Gen Z gathered in one place.”

```
permeate ~ verb ~ to spread through something and be present in every part of it

Army general Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces and one of the most powerful men in the Russian military, is **credited** as the chief architect of Russia’s modern warfare strategy.

The two are accused of the war crimes of directing attacks at civilian objects and of causing excessive **incidental** harm to civilians or damage to civilian objects, and are also accused of crimes against humanity.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s **chief of staff**, Andriy Yermak, said he discussed Sunday’s attack – the first of its kind in the war – with US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Monday.

While visiting the building, the European Union’s ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova, noted the “**gaping** hole” left by the impact and missile **remnants** and said: “It’s only because the missile was unable to fully **detonate** that the entire building wasn’t turned into ruins.”
