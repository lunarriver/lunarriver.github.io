Nepal’s prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, has resigned after some of the worst unrest in decades rocked the country this week, set off by a ban on social media and **discontentment** at political corruption and **nepotism**.

```

nepotism ~ noun

```
quell ~ verb ~ to stop something, especially by using force
```

In defiance of **curfews**, protests continued to erupt across the country on Tuesday and thousands stormed the federal parliament building in the capital, Kathmandu, and set it on fire. Car **tyres** were burned in the streets of Kathmandu and riot police were **pelted** with stones.

```
designate ~ verb ~ to choose someone officially to do a particular job
```

“The social media ban was not the only agenda of the Gen Z movement.

That is why Gen Z gathered in one place.”

```

Army general Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces and one of the most powerful men in the Russian military, is **credited** as the chief architect of Russia’s modern warfare strategy.
