In defiance of **curfews**, protests continued to erupt across the country on Tuesday and thousands stormed the federal parliament building in the capital, Kathmandu, and set it on fire. Car **tyres** were burned in the streets of Kathmandu and riot police were **pelted** with stones.

```

“The social media ban was not the only agenda of the Gen Z movement.
