#### [Anti-Islamic biker gang members hired to run security at controversial Gaza aid sites | Gaza | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/anti-islamic-biker-gang-infidels-mc-gaza-aid-sites)

The investigation found that more than 10 members of Infidels MC, a US biker gang that uses the Crusader cross as its symbol and whose members have anti-Islamic **tattoos**, have been hired by UG Solutions and deployed to food aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

Mulford, whose **affiliation** with GHF was public, accidentally sent an email to the BBC telling other leaders of the group not to comment on inquiries – inadvertently revealing the identities of several other senior **Infidels** members also working for UG Solutions.

GHF’s operations have come under scrutiny as the US and Israeli-backed group has **supplanted** nearly every other major humanitarian organisation working in the Gaza Strip in what critics have called a deliberate effort to politicise humanitarian aid.

#### [Israeli airstrikes ‘killed any hope’ for hostages in Gaza, says Qatari prime minister | Israel | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/israel-threats-outrage-qatar-strike-hamas)

Meanwhile in Sana’a, people said Wednesday’s attack had struck a **hideout** between two mountains that was used as a command-and-control headquarters. The extent of any damage was not immediately clear.

#### [Israel launches ground offensive deep inside Gaza City | Gaza | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-launches-ground-offensive-deep-inside-gaza-city)

“We will not **relent** until the mission is completed.”

“It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the **criteria** set forth in the genocide convention,” said Navi Pillay.

Netanyahu sought to brace the country for greater economic isolation in a speech on Monday in which he said it would have to “adapt to an economy with **autarkic** features”, suggesting it would have to be more self-reliant with fewer trade options.

Tess Ingram, a spokesperson for the UN child protection agency, Unicef, said there was no safe **haven** for the displaced population.

“It is inhumane to expect nearly half a million children, battered and **traumatised** by over 700 days of unrelenting conflict, to flee one hellscape and end up in another.”.

His critics have long argued he has prolonged the Gaza war to put off elections, stay in office and thereby preserve his legal **immunity**.

Once the ground offensive was launched, Donald Trump directed blame at Hamas, telling reporters at the White House that the militants would have “**hell to pay**” if it used the surviving hostages as human shields during the assault.

#### [Saudi Arabia and Pakistan sign mutual defence pact as regional tensions escalate | Saudi Arabia | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/saudi-arabia-pakistan-mutual-defence-pact)

The pact on Wednesday could shift the strategic **calculus** in a complex region.

#### [UK preparing to recognise Palestinian state as early as Friday | Palestinian territories | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/uk-preparing-to-recognise-palestinian-state-as-early-as-friday)

The UK prime minister said recognition was “part of that overall package which hopefully takes us from the **appalling** situation we’re in now to the outcome of a safe and secure Israel, which we do not have, and a viable Palestinian state”.

The UK Foreign Office had long **parried** calls for recognition, saying the step should only be taken when it had maximum impact on the peace process.

#### [What role has Britain played in the history of Israel and Palestine? | Palestinian territories | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/what-role-has-britain-played-in-the-history-of-israel-and-palestine)

The following April, the members of the triple **entente** – France, Russia and Great Britain – started to secretly negotiate backroom plans for the Middle East on the assumption that the Ottoman empire would collapse.

Between 1915 and 1916, secret talks led to the Sykes-Picot agreement, a Franco-British deal fully disclosed only 20 years later, to **carve up** the Middle East.

At the same time, Arab leaders believed that in **correspondence** between Sharif Hussein, the **custodian** of the Islamic holy cities of Medina and Mecca, and Sir Harold McMahon, the high commissioner of Egypt, a clear commitment was given that Britain would support a **revolt** against the Ottomans and promote an independent Arab state covering the whole of Ottoman Asia.

In 1922, despite the promises of independence, Britain’s right to retain the mandate for Palestine was granted by the **League** of Nations and the Balfour declaration was included as part of that mandate.

In 1936 the Palestinians’ increasing frustration with the British led to open revolt, and then a brutal repression. The UK’s Peel commission decided reluctantly in 1937 that **partition** was the only answer, even though it would entail the mass displacement of Palestinians.

On the eve of the second world war in 1939, in an attempt to **mollify** both sides, a UK white paper said it favoured a Palestinian state within 10 years.

#### [UK, Canada and Australia announce formal recognition of Palestine, with wave of Israel’s allies to follow | Palestinian territories | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/uk-canada-and-australia-announce-formal-recognition-of-palestine-with-wave-of-israel-allies-to-follow)

A wave of Israel’s allies are announcing their recognition of the state of Palestine, as part of a wider manoeuvre designed to **ostracise** Hamas and challenge attempts by the Israeli government to erase the chance of a Palestinian homeland.

The delicate and partly symbolic move by as many 10 states, **pioneered** largely by the French government, has the potential to lead to a negative spiral of further confrontation.

At the centre of the French plan, now fully endorsed by Arab states, is to make recognition part of a wider process, including a reformed, democratically elected Palestinian Authority that in the event of a ceasefire comes to **supersede** a disarmed and dismantled Hamas in Gaza.

He insisted recognition was not a reward for Hamas, since the terrorist group wanted an Islamic state and the destruction of Israel, something a two-state solution would **preclude**.

The US state department has tried to block Abbas from speaking from the **rostrum** at the UN in New York by denying US visas to the PA, a move that triggered a 145 to five vote at the UN general assembly to allow him to speak via a video link.

But the French argue the move has already brought concessions by Abbas on deradicalisation, and his **denunciation** of the 7 October attack as a terrorist act.

His proposals have been **roundly** rejected by Netanyahu.

The **quartet** are rallying countries around an emergency aid package to prevent the collapse of the PA.

#### [Disruption across Italy as tens of thousands protest against Gaza war | Italy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/22/disruption-across-italy-as-tens-of-thousands-protest-against-gaza-war)

From Milan to Palermo, Italians poured on to the streets in at least 75 **municipalities** across the country.

Michelangelo, 17, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) he had turned up to support “a population that is being **exterminated**”.

Meloni has repeatedly voiced concerns about the Israeli offence but her far-right government – which has sought to **foster** close ties with Donald Trump’s administration in the US – has adopted a cautious stance on the war in Gaza.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/23/british-officials-fear-donald-trump-could-recognise-israeli-west-bank-settlements

Trump made **passing** reference to Palestinian recognition during a **fiery** speech at the UN on Tuesday, saying: “This would be a reward for these horrible atrocities, including October 7.”

That move would **render** impossible a single Palestinian state covering the West Bank and Gaza.

Starmer spent much of his bilateral meeting with Trump last week explaining the reasons for recognising Palestine, and British officials were delighted when the US president appeared **sanguine** about the prospect in their joint press conference.

With Trump’s **blessing**, the UAE signed the accords in 2020 after Israel agreed to drop a proposal to annex parts of the West Bank.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/israeli-attempt-to-annex-west-bank-would-be-red-line-for-us-says-macron

On the other hand, if Netanyahu went ahead with annexation – with US endorsement or **quiescence** – the plan for a two-state solution in which a Palestinian state sits alongside Israel would be in serious **jeopardy**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/washington-backing-plan-for-tony-blair-to-head-transitional-gaza-authority

If approved, Blair would head a secretariat of up to 25 people and chair a seven-person **board** to oversee an executive body running the territory.

But Blair is bitterly **resented** by many Palestinians – who see him as having impeded their efforts to **attain** statehood – and more broadly across the region for his role in backing the 2003 US invasion of Iraq.

But that lack of **specificity**, and the presence of Blair, would be seen as a reassurance for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Arab states may argue that the Blair plan does not set out an **irreversible** course to statehood, but instead represents a different, more **benign** occupation than that provided by Israel.

In an attempt to assuage fears that the plan will lead to tens of thousands of Palestinians being forced out of Gaza during the reconstruction, a “property rights preservation unit” would be established, aimed at ensuring that any **voluntary** departure of Palestinians from Gaza does not compromise their right to return to the territory or retain property ownership.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/27/israeli-strikes-kill-people-gaza-city-attack

He added that 14 **premature** babies were treated in **incubators** in Helou hospital, though its head of **neonatal** intensive care, Dr. Nasser Bulbul, said the facility’s main gate had been closed because of drones flying over the building.

Dozens of delegates staged a walkout as he took to the **podium**, while protesters against Israel’s war gathered outside.

“This is the last thing we wanted, as the needs in Gaza City are enormous, with the most at-risk people – **infants** in neonatal care, people with severe injuries and life-threatening illnesses – unable to move and in grave danger.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/28/israel-presses-on-with-gaza-assault-as-trump-again-claims-ceasefire-is-close

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have complied with repeated orders to evacuate but many others have been unable to flee, often because they are ill, disabled, too **frail** or unable to afford expensive transport to safer areas.

The flotilla, which was struck in international waters off Crete on Wednesday by drones armed with **stun** grenades and **irritants**, rejected the suggestion.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/optimism-grows-for-gaza-peace-deal-as-top-us-qatari-and-turkish-officials-join-talks

Though Hamas has agreed to three parts of Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza – **namely** the release of all hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, surrendering power in the strip and Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza – the rest of the deal still needs to be discussed.

Logistics of a hostage-prisoner swap still need to be **ironed out**.

Trump has said that he wants Israeli hostages to be released this week and has threatened Hamas with “total **obliteration**” if it does not agree to the deal.

The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, criticised the ministerial meeting for not including the country, describing it as being “**concocted** behind Israel’s back”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/almost-55000-children-in-gaza-acutely-malnourished-lancet-study-estimates

Almost 55,000 children in Gaza are estimated to be acutely **malnourished**, the respected international medical **periodical** has revealed.

In January 2024, 5% of children screened showed evidence of **wasting**, researchers found. After Israel imposed severe aid restrictions from the end of 2024, the **prevalence** of wasting had almost doubled by January 2025.

Dr Masako Horino is nutrition **epidemiologist** at Unrwa and lead scientist for the study.

Leading child health experts and **paediatricians** said the study was particularly “notable and important”.

Bhutta also praised the researchers for using scientific evidence “to show **grievous**, preventable harm to children”.

“There should also be “serious concern” over its long-term health effects, which included “**inordinately** high risks of non-communicable diseases”, they added.

Unrwa has been accused by Benjamin Netanyahu of being “**perforated** by Hamas” and banned by Israel.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/how-the-gaza-ceasefire-deal-was-done-donald-trump

It is a well-known **adage** in politics that success has many parents, but failure is an **orphan**.

The turning point was a meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN general assembly chaired by Trump, soon after his **baroque** speech to the gathering.

“People don’t want to hear this but the advantage of Trump is that once he decides to do something he is like a **juggernaut**.”

As a result Netanyahu, not a man prone to **contrition**, was ordered to apologise and say he would respect Qatar’s sovereignty in future.

The concept that Trump personally was central to a solution – indeed its guarantor – **flattered** the US president who offered himself up as the chair of the peace board, the body that would oversee the reconstruction of Gaza.

In one sense, he would be just a name plate, but to the extent he has a **hinterland**, it is construction.

The prospect of winning the Nobel peace prize, Trump’s **obsession**, hovered once more into view.

That meant that once his plan was published Trump did not let go, but kept the pressure up on Hamas, warning of the group’s **annihilation** if it did not release the hostages in return for 250 Palestinians.

It was the **seniority** of the negotiators who went to the talks in Egypt that revealed the stars were finally aligning and Hamas would be forced into releasing all the hostages it held.

During the talks, Hamas negotiators sought to clarify the names of the Palestinians to be released, **poring** over the maps showing a withdrawal of Israel’s forces.

On the agenda are issues such as the future relationship between Gaza and the West Bank as the **nucleus** of a future Palestinian state.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/israeli-hostage-release-hamas-gaza-last-living

They said: “After more than 700 long, painful, and **agonizing** days, Omri will finally receive from his children Roni and Alma a healing embrace.

An estimate 65,000 people gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Monday morning roared their **approval** as it was announced from a stage that the first seven live hostages had been released to the Red Cross.

Julie Kupershtein, the mother of hostage Bar Kupershtein, who was working at the Nova Music Festival as a **paramedic** when he was taken, spoke to him in a video call.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/hamas-deploys-armed-fighters-and-police-across-parts-of-gaza

Donald Trump suggested the militant Islamist organisation was acting within the **parameters** of the ceasefire deal.

**Simultaneously**, Israeli authorities began freeing about 2,000 prisoners, including 250 serving lengthy sentences.

Hundreds of trucks of aid and commercial goods have entered Gaza since Sunday, sending prices in markets **tumbling**.

Law and order has collapsed across much of Gaza, with armed families, **clans**, gangs, looters and militia growing more powerful.

“**Repent** before it is too late – there is no Hamas from today onward,” he said in a social media post.

One Hamas security official said a hunt was under way for Abu Shabab, adding that one of the fugitive leader’s aides had been “**liquidated**” in recent days.

But “the gate for **repentance** and general amnesty” was open for all those who joined “gangs” but were not involved in any murders.

Hamas flags and **headbands** were absent.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/14/released-israeli-hostages-speak-of-torture-torment-and-co-existence

Some described being tortured and **tormented**.

She could be seen screaming to him from a Hamas vehicle as he was walked away at **gunpoint**.

Omri Miran, 48, a father of two and **shiatsu** **massage** **therapist**, was held in 23 different places in Gaza.

“They covered him with black **sacks** and dragged him away.”

Other lies told by captors, she said, included the claim that his **maternal** grandparents – who are Holocaust survivors – were dead.

He believed that the captors were motivated to feed him following the international outcry over the video of an **emaciated** David being forced to dig his own grave.

The brothers, who work together as **lighting technicians**, gave a thumbs-up to the cameras on their release as they were driven away back home together.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/marco-rubio-warning-israel-west-bank-donald-trump

A bill applying Israeli law to the occupied West Bank, a move **tantamount** to the annexation of land Palestinians want for a state, won **preliminary** approval from Israel’s parliament on Wednesday.

Defying Netanyahu’s warnings – he had also urged MPs from his Likud party to **abstain** – shouting **erupted** in the Knesset during the vote.

Since then, successive governments have tried to permanently **cement** Israeli control over the land.

In August, Israel approved a long-delayed settlement project, **bisecting** the territory and further undermining hopes for a viable Palestinian state.

Construction in the so-called E1 area has been stalled for more than two decades amid international opposition, but a defence ministry committee gave the **go-ahead** for 3,400 homes.

Video footage of the attack shows the man striking her unconscious with a stick before hitting her again as she lay **motionless** on the ground.

Meanwhile, on Thursday Israel’s supreme court held a hearing into whether to open the Gaza Strip to the international media, giving the state 30 days to present a new position **in light of** the ceasefire.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/donald-trump-sanae-takaichi-japan-prime-minister-rare-earths-agreement

Trump is scheduled to meet China’s Xi Jinping in South Korea this week for high-stakes talks amid a **bruising** trade war.

In a day of **profuse** mutual praise, Takaichi said she would nominate Trump for the Nobel peace prize – an **accolade** he has **coveted** since his return to the White House.

Takaichi congratulated Trump on his role in securing ceasefires in Gaza and between Thailand and Cambodia, which have been **embroiled** in a border dispute.

Takaichi, an Abe **protege** who shares his hardline stance against China’s military buildup in the region, thanked Trump for his “enduring friendship” with Abe, who was assassinated in 2022.

Takaichi presented Trump with Abe’s **putter** in a glass case, a golf bag signed by the Japanese major winner Hideki Matsuyama and a set of gold-leaf golf balls, according to Kyodo news agency.

Yokota’s then 13-year-old daughter Megumi was **snatched** from near her home on the Japan Sea coast in 1977 and taken to the North.

Takaichi thanked the 6,000 sailors onboard for helping defend Japan and the wider region, telling them that Tokyo was ready to “fundamentally reinforce” its defence capabilities and contribute even more **proactively** to peace and stability in the region”.

Trump said it was an honour to meet her so soon after the launch of her administration, predicting, with typical **effusiveness**, that she would go on to be one of the country’s “greatest prime ministers”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/israeli-strikes-in-gaza-overnight-as-ceasefire-looks-increasingly-fragile

Netanyahu called an emergency meeting to discuss what he called Hamas violations of the ceasefire, as far-right figures in the Israeli government **clamoured** for a return to war.

The US vice-president, JD Vance, said earlier that the ceasefire was holding despite “**skirmishes**”.

However, Tuesday night’s attack exposed all the **frailties** of a ceasefire that from the **outset** has been **marred** by violence.

On Wednesday the IDF said it had **reinstated** the Gaza ceasefire.

The Israeli military published footage of what it said were members of Hamas **reburying** a body in order to “stage a false discovery” for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which it said was Hamas “attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies”.

The news has enraged Israelis, with the far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich **lashing** out at Hamas and calling on Netanyahu to resume the war.

The militant group has said it does not know the precise **whereabouts** of all the bodies.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/israel-remains-hostages-gaza-hamas

On Saturday night, Moran Harari urged Israel to **have restraint**.

It is unclear if the Palestinians were **recovered** from Gaza by troops during the war.

Israel’s prime minister said earlier on Sunday that “there are still **pockets** of Hamas” in parts of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces.

The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and **staffed by** medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

Israel, which has denied accusations by a UN commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry’s figures without providing a **contradicting toll**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/israel-carries-out-wave-of-airstrikes-on-southern-lebanon

Under the terms of the deal, Hezbollah is to disarm, both parties are **meant to** stop firing on each other.

Thursday’s strikes were unusual in their intensity and for being **preceded** by an evacuation warning.

Lebanon’s government has committed to disarming Hezbollah and ensuring the **monopoly** of weapons lies with the state.

Israel has pressed the Lebanese government to move more quickly on disarmament, but it has said that to do so would risk **inflaming** internal civil **strife**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/20/israeli-airstrikes-gaza-ceasefire-khan-younis

“The intensity of the death toll has decreased, but **martyrs** and shelling happen every day.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/07/first-phase-trump-israel-gaza-ceasefire-plan-netanyahu

Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the first phase of the UN-**endorsed** Gaza ceasefire plan is close to completion.

The Israeli prime minister said he would discuss the next steps later this month in Washington with Donald Trump, whose Gaza proposals were **codified** in a UN security council resolution on 17 November.

Netanyahu dismisses the warrants as “**trumped**-up charges” from a “corrupt prosecutor”.

“I think it’s important to make sure that Hamas complies not only with the ceasefire, but also with their commitment which they **undertook** to disarm and have Gaza demilitarise,” he said.

He stressed that Israel was **adamantly** opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state.

Netanyahu said the reason he would not be able make a return visit to Germany was the ICC arrest warrants, which he described as **fabricated** by the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, as a means of diverting attention from allegations of sexual harassment against him.

Another **tribunal**, the international court of justice, is weighing up charges that Israeli has committed genocide in Gaza.
