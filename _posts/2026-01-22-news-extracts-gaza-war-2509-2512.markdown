#### [Anti-Islamic biker gang members hired to run security at controversial Gaza aid sites | Gaza | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/anti-islamic-biker-gang-infidels-mc-gaza-aid-sites)

The investigation found that more than 10 members of Infidels MC, a US biker gang that uses the Crusader cross as its symbol and whose members have anti-Islamic **tattoos**, have been hired by UG Solutions and deployed to food aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

Mulford, whose **affiliation** with GHF was public, accidentally sent an email to the BBC telling other leaders of the group not to comment on inquiries – inadvertently revealing the identities of several other senior **Infidels** members also working for UG Solutions.

GHF’s operations have come under scrutiny as the US and Israeli-backed group has **supplanted** nearly every other major humanitarian organisation working in the Gaza Strip in what critics have called a deliberate effort to politicise humanitarian aid.

Meanwhile in Sana’a, people said Wednesday’s attack had struck a **hideout** between two mountains that was used as a command-and-control headquarters. The extent of any damage was not immediately clear.

“We will not **relent** until the mission is completed.”

“It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the **criteria** set forth in the genocide convention,” said Navi Pillay.

Netanyahu sought to brace the country for greater economic isolation in a speech on Monday in which he said it would have to “adapt to an economy with **autarkic** features”, suggesting it would have to be more self-reliant with fewer trade options.

Tess Ingram, a spokesperson for the UN child protection agency, Unicef, said there was no safe **haven** for the displaced population.

“It is inhumane to expect nearly half a million children, battered and **traumatised** by over 700 days of unrelenting conflict, to flee one hellscape and end up in another.”.

His critics have long argued he has prolonged the Gaza war to put off elections, stay in office and thereby preserve his legal **immunity**.

Once the ground offensive was launched, Donald Trump directed blame at Hamas, telling reporters at the White House that the militants would have “**hell to pay**” if it used the surviving hostages as human shields during the assault.

#### [UK preparing to recognise Palestinian state as early as Friday | Palestinian territories | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/uk-preparing-to-recognise-palestinian-state-as-early-as-friday)

The UK prime minister said recognition was “part of that overall package which hopefully takes us from the **appalling** situation we’re in now to the outcome of a safe and secure Israel, which we do not have, and a viable Palestinian state”.

The UK Foreign Office had long **parried** calls for recognition, saying the step should only be taken when it had maximum impact on the peace process.

#### [What role has Britain played in the history of Israel and Palestine? | Palestinian territories | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/what-role-has-britain-played-in-the-history-of-israel-and-palestine)

In 1914 when the first world war began, the Ottoman empire threw in its **lot** with the **central powers** and Britain’s response was to declare Egypt a British protectorate. The following April, the members of the triple **entente** – France, Russia and Great Britain – started to secretly negotiate backroom plans for the Middle East on the assumption that the Ottoman empire would collapse.

Between 1915 and 1916, secret talks led to the Sykes-Picot agreement, a Franco-British deal fully disclosed only 20 years later, to **carve up** the Middle East.

At the same time, Arab leaders believed that in **correspondence** between Sharif Hussein, the **custodian** of the Islamic holy cities of Medina and Mecca, and Sir Harold McMahon, the high commissioner of Egypt, a clear commitment was given that Britain would support a **revolt** against the Ottomans and promote an independent Arab state covering the whole of Ottoman Asia.

In 1922, despite the promises of independence, Britain’s right to retain the mandate for Palestine was granted by the **League** of Nations and the Balfour declaration was included as part of that mandate.

In 1936 the Palestinians’ increasing frustration with the British led to open revolt, and then a brutal repression. The UK’s Peel commission decided **reluctantly** in 1937 that **partition** was the only answer, even though it would **entail** the mass displacement of Palestinians.

On the eve of the second world war in 1939, in an attempt to **mollify** both sides, a UK white paper said it favoured a Palestinian state within 10 years.

#### [UK, Canada and Australia announce formal recognition of Palestine, with wave of Israel’s allies to follow | Palestinian territories | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/uk-canada-and-australia-announce-formal-recognition-of-palestine-with-wave-of-israel-allies-to-follow)

A wave of Israel’s allies are announcing their recognition of the state of Palestine, as part of a wider manoeuvre designed to **ostracise** Hamas and challenge attempts by the Israeli government to erase the chance of a Palestinian homeland.

The UK, Canada and Australia formally declared their recognition of Palestinian **statehood** on Sunday in separate but coordinated statements.

The delicate and partly symbolic move by as many 10 states, **pioneered** largely by the French government, has the potential to lead to a negative spiral of further confrontation.

The declarations with various conditions and **emphases** attached reflect the conflicting domestic pressures on governments as they face a backlash from Israel, and from hostage families that claim the move effectively rewards Hamas for its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.

At the centre of the French plan, now fully endorsed by Arab states, is to make recognition part of a wider process, including a reformed, democratically elected Palestinian Authority that in the event of a ceasefire comes to **supersede** a disarmed and dismantled Hamas in Gaza.

Macron, identified by Israel as the **galvanising** force behind the surge in recognitions, went on Israel’s Channel 12 to warn “the approach of your government and some ministers especially is to destroy the possibility of a two-state solution.”

```
ostracise ~ verb ~ to avoid someone intentionally, or to prevent someone from taking part in the activities of a group

statehood ~ noun ~ the condition of being a country or a part of a large country that has its own government

pioneer ~ verb ~ a person who is one of the first people to do something

supersede ~ verb ~ to replace something, especially something older or more old-fashioned

galvanise ~ verb ~ to cause someone to suddenly take action, especially by shocking or exciting them in some way
```

He insisted recognition was not a reward for Hamas, since the terrorist group wanted an Islamic state and the destruction of Israel, something a two-state solution would **preclude**.

The US state department has tried to block Abbas from speaking from the **rostrum** at the UN in New York by denying US visas to the PA, a move that triggered a 145 to five vote at the UN general assembly to allow him to speak via a video link.

But the French argue the move has already brought concessions by Abbas on **deradicalisation**, and his **denunciation** of the 7 October attack as a terrorist act.

His proposals have been **roundly** rejected by Netanyahu.

The **quartet** are rallying countries around an emergency aid package to prevent the collapse of the PA.

```
preclude ~ verb ~ to prevent something or make it impossible, or prevent someone from doing something

rostrum ~ noun ~ a raised surface on which a person making a speech or a music conductor (= leader) stands

deradicalisation ~ noun ~ the process of making someone become less radical (= extreme) in their political or religious beliefs

denunciation ~ noun ~ public criticism of something or someone

roundly ~ adverb ~ severely

quartet ~ noun ~ a group of four people who play musical instruments or sing as a group

#### [Disruption across Italy as tens of thousands protest against Gaza war | Italy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/22/disruption-across-italy-as-tens-of-thousands-protest-against-gaza-war)

The prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has previously said it could be **counterproductive** to recognise the state of Palestine before it was established.

Grassroots unions across Italy called for a 24-hour general strike on Monday in solidarity with the people of Gaza, citing reasons that included the “**inertia** of the Italian and EU governments” to address the humanitarian crisis in the territory.

From Milan to Palermo, Italians poured on to the streets in at least 75 **municipalities** across the country.

Michelangelo, 17, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) he had turned up to support “a population that is being **exterminated**”.

Tensions escalated in Milan when dozens of protesters dressed in black and armed with batons tried to **smash** the main entrance of the city’s central train station.

More than 10 people were arrested in Milan and about 60 police officers suffered **bruising** or more serious injuries, according to Italy’s Ansa news agency.

Meloni has repeatedly voiced concerns about the Israeli offence but her far-right government – which has sought to **foster** close ties with Donald Trump’s administration in the US – has adopted a cautious stance on the war in Gaza.

The transport minister, Matteo Salvini, **downplayed** the impact of the protests on Monday, describing them as the “political mobilisation of far-left unionists” and praising those who had gone to work.

```
counterproductive ~ noun ~ having an effect that is opposite to the one intended or wanted

inertia ~ adjective ~ lack of activity or interest, or unwillingness to make an effort to do anything

municipality ~ noun ~ a city or town with its own local government, or the local government itself

exterminate ~ verb ~ to kill all the animals or people in a particular place or of a particular type

smash ~ verb ~ to cause something to break noisily into a lot of small pieces

bruise ~ verb ~ to develop a bruise or to cause someone or something to have a bruise

foster ~ verb ~ to encourage the development or growth of ideas or feelings

downplay ~ verb ~ to make something seem less important or less bad than it really is
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/23/british-officials-fear-donald-trump-could-recognise-israeli-west-bank-settlements

Trump made **passing** reference to Palestinian recognition during a **fiery** speech at the UN on Tuesday, saying: “This would be a reward for these horrible atrocities, including October 7.”

That move would **render** impossible a single Palestinian state covering the West Bank and Gaza.

Starmer spent much of his bilateral meeting with Trump last week explaining the reasons for recognising Palestine, and British officials were delighted when the US president appeared **sanguine** about the prospect in their joint press conference.

Under the Blair plan, which one British government source called “**the only game in town**”, Gaza would be governed by a UN-backed international transitional authority, without needing to expel Palestinians from the territory.

With Trump’s **blessing**, the UAE signed the accords in 2020 after Israel agreed to drop a proposal to annex parts of the West Bank.

```
passing ~ ajective ~ lasting only for a short time and not important or complete

fiery ~ adjective ~ showing very strong feeling

render ~ verb ~ to cause someone or something to be in a particular state

sanguine ~ adjective ~ (of someone or someone's character) positive and hoping for good things

bless ~ verb ~ agree
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/israeli-attempt-to-annex-west-bank-would-be-red-line-for-us-says-macron

On the other hand, if Netanyahu went ahead with annexation – with US endorsement or **quiescence** – the plan for a two-state solution in which a Palestinian state sits alongside Israel would be in serious **jeopardy**.

Macron said the fate of hostages and Gaza’s **civilian** population should not be “left in the hands of those for whom the release of hostages is not a priority”.

```
quiescence ~ noun ~ the state of being temporarily quiet and not active

jeopardy ~ noun ~ in danger of being damaged or destroyed

civilian ~ noun ~ a person who is not a member of the police or the armed forces
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/washington-backing-plan-for-tony-blair-to-head-transitional-gaza-authority

According to reports in Haaretz and the Times of Israel, the plan is **modelled** on the administrations that initially oversaw Timor-Leste and Kosovo’s transitions to statehood.

If approved, Blair would head a **secretariat** of up to 25 people and chair a seven-person **board** to oversee an executive body running the territory.

But Blair is bitterly **resented** by many Palestinians – who see him as having **impeded** their efforts to **attain** statehood – and more broadly across the region for his role in backing the 2003 US invasion of Iraq.

```
model ~ verb ~ to make a model of something

secretariat ~ verb ~ the office or people responsible for the management of an organization, especially an international or political one

board ~ noun ~ the group of people who are responsible for controlling and organizing a company or organization

resent ~ verb ~ to feel angry because you have been forced to accept someone or something that you do not like

impede ~ verb ~ to make it more difficult for something to happen or more difficult for someone to do something

attain ~ verb ~ to reach or succeed in getting something
```

Some western diplomats stressed it was **by no means** a **done** deal that Blair would run the interim Palestinian administration, and said it might be in place for only two years.

News of the plan emerged just days after the UN general assembly endorsed a different plan for a **technocratic** administration to take charge in Gaza.

The lack of a clear timeline for a transition to PA control under the White House plan is seen as a potential **roadblock** to its endorsement by Palestinians and Arab leaders. But that lack of **specificity**, and the presence of Blair, would be seen as a reassurance for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Arab states may argue that the Blair plan does not set out an **irreversible** course to statehood, but instead represents a different, more **benign** occupation than that provided by Israel.

```
technocratic ~ adjective ~ relating to or involving experts in science or technology who have a lot of power in government or business

roadblock ~ noun ~ a temporary structure put across a road to stop traffic

specificity ~ noun ~ the quality of being specific (= clear and exact)

irreversible ~ adjective ~ not possible to change; impossible to return to a previous condition

benign ~ adjective ~ pleasant and kind
```

The commissioner would also “track PA reform efforts in coordination with international **donors**, financial institutions and Arab partners engaged in Palestinian institutional development”.

The PEA would also receive reports from the Gaza municipalities, which would be responsible for delivering services at the local level; a judicial board chaired by an Arab **jurist** who will supervise Gaza’s courts and public prosecution office; and the **aforementioned** “Property Rights Preservation Unit”.

In an attempt to assuage fears that the plan will lead to tens of thousands of Palestinians being forced out of Gaza during the reconstruction, a “property rights preservation unit” would be established, aimed at ensuring that any **voluntary** departure of Palestinians from Gaza does not compromise their right to return to the territory or retain property ownership.

Abbas addressed the **gathering** by video **conference** after his visa was revoked by the US in the **run-up** to the 80th session of the UN general assembly.

```
donor ~ noun ~ a person who gives money or goods to an organization

jurist ~ noun ~ an expert in law, especially a judge

aforementioned ~ adjective ~ mentioned earlier

voluntary ~ noun ~ done, made, or given willingly, without being forced or paid to do it

conference ~ noun ~ an event, sometimes lasting a few days, at which there is a group of talks on a particular subject, or a meeting in which especially business matters are discussed formally
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/27/israeli-strikes-kill-people-gaza-city-attack

He added that 14 **premature** babies were treated in **incubators** in Helou hospital, though its head of **neonatal** intensive care, Dr. Nasser Bulbul, said the facility’s main gate had been closed because of drones flying over the building.

Dozens of delegates staged a **walkout** as he took to the **podium**, while protesters against Israel’s war gathered outside.

“We have been left with no choice but to stop our activities as our clinics are encircled by Israeli forces,” said Jacob Granger, the **charity**’s emergency coordinator in Gaza. “This is the last thing we wanted, as the needs in Gaza City are enormous, with the most at-risk people – **infants** in neonatal care, people with severe injuries and life-threatening illnesses – unable to move and in grave danger.”

```
premature ~ adjective ~ happening or done too soon, especially before the natural or suitable time

incubator ~ noun ~ a container that has controlled air and temperature conditions in which a weak or premature baby (= one which was born too early) can be kept alive

neonatal ~ adjective ~ of or for babies that were born recently

walkout ~ noun ~ the act of leaving an official meeting as a group in order to show disapproval, or of leaving a place of work to start a strike

podium ~ noun ~ a raised area on which a person stands to speak to a large number of people, to conduct music, or to receive a prize in a sports competition

charity ~ noun ~ help, especially in the form of money, given freely to people who are in need, for example because they are ill, poor, or have no home, and organizations that provide this help

infant ~ noun ~ a baby or a very young child
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/28/israel-presses-on-with-gaza-assault-as-trump-again-claims-ceasefire-is-close

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have complied with repeated orders to evacuate but many others have been unable to flee, often because they are ill, disabled, too **frail** or unable to afford expensive transport to safer areas.

Hamas’s armed **wing** urged the Israeli military to halt airstrikes temporarily and withdraw from part of Gaza City on Sunday to allow it to locate two Israeli hostages it said it had lost contact with there.

Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday: “We have a real chance for **GREATNESS** IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ALL ARE **ON BOARD** FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!!”

He promised at the start of his second term in office a quick end to the war but eight months later a resolution remains **elusive**.

The flotilla, which was struck in international waters off Crete on Wednesday by drones armed with **stun** grenades and **irritants**, rejected the suggestion.

In the occupied West Bank on Sunday, Israeli security forces shot dead an alleged attacker in a car-**ramming** incident in which an Israeli man was seriously injured at a **junction** near Nablus. Hamas praised the attack.

```
frail ~ adjective ~ weak or unhealthy, or easily damaged, broken, or harmed

wing ~ noun ~ a group within a political party or organization whose beliefs are in some way different from those of the main group

greatness ~ noun ~ importance and fame, power, or success

elusive ~ adjective ~ difficult to describe, find, achieve, or remember

stun ~ verb ~ to shock or surprise someone very much

irritant ~ noun ~ a substance that makes part of your body sore or painful

ram ~ verb ~ to hit or push something with force

junction ~ noun ~ a place where things, especially roads or railways, come together
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/optimism-grows-for-gaza-peace-deal-as-top-us-qatari-and-turkish-officials-join-talks

“You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first,” read the hand-scrawled note on White House **stationery**.

Though Hamas has agreed to three parts of Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza – **namely** the release of all hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, surrendering power in the strip and Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza – the rest of the deal still needs to be discussed.

Logistics of a hostage-prisoner swap still need to be **ironed out**.

The Trump administration and its Arab allies, as well as regional players such as Turkey, have thrown their **weight** behind the current round of peace talks in an effort to quickly push through a truce that has **evaded** negotiators for two years. Trump has said that he wants Israeli hostages to be released this week and has threatened Hamas with “total **obliteration**” if it does not agree to the deal.

The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, criticised the ministerial meeting for not including the country, describing it as being “**concocted** behind Israel’s back”. Saar said that he hoped the meeting would not **jeopardise** the release of hostages.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/almost-55000-children-in-gaza-acutely-malnourished-lancet-study-estimates

Almost 55,000 children in Gaza are estimated to be acutely **malnourished**, the respected international medical **periodical** has revealed.

The study offers a month-by-month **breakdown** through much of the two-year conflict.

In January 2024, 5% of children screened showed evidence of **wasting**, researchers found. After Israel imposed severe aid restrictions from the end of 2024, the **prevalence** of wasting had almost doubled by January 2025.

Dr Masako Horino is nutrition **epidemiologist** at Unrwa and lead scientist for the study.

“Tens of thousands of preschool aged children in the Gaza Strip are now suffering from **preventable** acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of **mortality**,” Horino said.

Leading child health experts and **paediatricians** said the study was particularly “notable and important”.

Bhutta also praised the researchers for using scientific evidence “to show **grievous**, preventable harm to children”.

“There should also be “serious concern” over its long-term health effects, which included “**inordinately** high risks of non-communicable diseases”, they added.

The study found that in Rafah, the southern city in Gaza, there was a fourfold increase in wasting malnutrition after Israel launched a massive offensive into the city and **levelled** it.

Unrwa has been accused by Benjamin Netanyahu of being “**perforated** by Hamas” and banned by Israel.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/how-the-gaza-ceasefire-deal-was-done-donald-trump

It is a well-known **adage** in politics that success has many parents, but failure is an **orphan**.

The turning point was a meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN general assembly chaired by Trump, soon after his **baroque** speech to the gathering.

That meant Trump dropping the **displacement** rhetoric he deployed earlier in the year, when he triggered widespread alarm by speaking of plans to develop a “Gaza Riviera”.

“People don’t want to hear this but the advantage of Trump is that once he decides to do something he is like a **juggernaut**.”

As a result Netanyahu, not a man prone to **contrition**, was ordered to apologise and say he would respect Qatar’s sovereignty in future.

The concept that Trump personally was central to a solution – indeed its guarantor – **flattered** the US president who offered himself up as the chair of the peace board, the body that would oversee the reconstruction of Gaza.

In one sense, he would be just a **name plate**, but to the extent he has a **hinterland**, it is construction.

The prospect of winning the Nobel peace prize, Trump’s **obsession**, hovered once more into view.

That meant that once his plan was published Trump did not let go, but kept the pressure up on Hamas, warning of the group’s **annihilation** if it did not release the hostages in return for 250 Palestinians.

It was the **seniority** of the negotiators who went to the talks in Egypt that revealed the **stars were finally aligning** and Hamas would be forced into releasing all the hostages it held.

During the talks, Hamas negotiators sought to clarify the names of the Palestinians to be released, **poring** over the maps showing a withdrawal of Israel’s forces.

He said: “You will see people **coexisting** and Gaza will be rebuilt.”

On the agenda are issues such as the future relationship between Gaza and the West Bank as the **nucleus** of a future Palestinian state.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/israeli-hostage-release-hamas-gaza-last-living

They said: “After more than 700 long, painful, and **agonizing** days, Omri will finally receive from his children Roni and Alma a healing embrace.

An estimate 65,000 people gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Monday morning roared their **approval** as it was announced from a stage that the first seven live hostages had been released to the Red Cross.

Julie Kupershtein, the mother of hostage Bar Kupershtein, who was working at the Nova Music Festival as a **paramedic** when he was taken, spoke to him in a video call.

“We were in the compound, and suddenly I had a conversation, suddenly I saw Bar. I screamed to the sky. Crazy. To see them, these pure, **righteous** children, alive. I’m shaking **all over**.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/hamas-deploys-armed-fighters-and-police-across-parts-of-gaza

Donald Trump suggested the militant Islamist organisation was acting within the **parameters** of the ceasefire deal.

**Simultaneously**, Israeli authorities began freeing about 2,000 prisoners, including 250 serving lengthy sentences.

Hundreds of trucks of aid and commercial goods have entered Gaza since Sunday, sending prices in markets **tumbling**.

Law and order has collapsed across much of Gaza, with armed families, **clans**, gangs, looters and militia growing more powerful.

“**Repent** before it is too late – there is no Hamas from today onward,” he said in a social media post.

One Hamas security official said a hunt was under way for Abu Shabab, adding that one of the fugitive leader’s aides had been “**liquidated**” in recent days.

But “the gate for **repentance** and general amnesty” was open for all those who joined “gangs” but were not involved in any murders.

Hamas flags and **headbands** were absent.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/14/released-israeli-hostages-speak-of-torture-torment-and-co-existence

Some described being tortured and **tormented**.

She could be seen screaming to him from a Hamas vehicle as he was walked away at **gunpoint**.

Omri Miran, 48, a father of two and **shiatsu** **massage** **therapist**, was held in 23 different places in Gaza.

“They covered him with black **sacks** and dragged him away.”

Other lies told by captors, she said, included the claim that his **maternal** grandparents – who are Holocaust survivors – were dead.

He believed that the captors were motivated to feed him following the international outcry over the video of an **emaciated** David being forced to dig his own grave.

The brothers, who work together as **lighting technicians**, gave a thumbs-up to the cameras on their release as they were driven away back home together.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/marco-rubio-warning-israel-west-bank-donald-trump

A bill applying Israeli law to the occupied West Bank, a move **tantamount** to the annexation of land Palestinians want for a state, won **preliminary** approval from Israel’s parliament on Wednesday.

Defying Netanyahu’s warnings – he had also urged MPs from his Likud party to **abstain** – shouting **erupted** in the Knesset during the vote.

Since then, successive governments have tried to permanently **cement** Israeli control over the land.

In August, Israel approved a long-delayed settlement project, **bisecting** the territory and further undermining hopes for a viable Palestinian state.

Construction in the so-called E1 area has been stalled for more than two decades amid international opposition, but a defence ministry committee gave the **go-ahead** for 3,400 homes.

Video footage of the attack shows the man striking her unconscious with a stick before hitting her again as she lay **motionless** on the ground.

Meanwhile, on Thursday Israel’s supreme court held a hearing into whether to open the Gaza Strip to the international media, giving the state 30 days to present a new position **in light of** the ceasefire.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/donald-trump-sanae-takaichi-japan-prime-minister-rare-earths-agreement

Trump is scheduled to meet China’s Xi Jinping in South Korea this week for high-stakes talks amid a **bruising** trade war.

In a day of **profuse** mutual praise, Takaichi said she would nominate Trump for the Nobel peace prize – an **accolade** he has **coveted** since his return to the White House.

Takaichi congratulated Trump on his role in securing ceasefires in Gaza and between Thailand and Cambodia, which have been **embroiled** in a border dispute.

Takaichi, an Abe **protege** who shares his hardline stance against China’s military buildup in the region, thanked Trump for his “enduring friendship” with Abe, who was assassinated in 2022.

Takaichi presented Trump with Abe’s **putter** in a glass case, a golf bag signed by the Japanese major winner Hideki Matsuyama and a set of gold-leaf golf balls, according to Kyodo news agency.

Yokota’s then 13-year-old daughter Megumi was **snatched** from near her home on the Japan Sea coast in 1977 and taken to the North.

Takaichi thanked the 6,000 sailors onboard for helping defend Japan and the wider region, telling them that Tokyo was ready to “fundamentally reinforce” its defence capabilities and contribute even more **proactively** to peace and stability in the region”.

Trump said it was an honour to meet her so soon after the launch of her administration, predicting, with typical **effusiveness**, that she would go on to be one of the country’s “greatest prime ministers”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/israeli-strikes-in-gaza-overnight-as-ceasefire-looks-increasingly-fragile

Netanyahu called an emergency meeting to discuss what he called Hamas violations of the ceasefire, as far-right figures in the Israeli government **clamoured** for a return to war.

The US vice-president, JD Vance, said earlier that the ceasefire was holding despite “**skirmishes**”.

However, Tuesday night’s attack exposed all the **frailties** of a ceasefire that from the **outset** has been **marred** by violence.

On Wednesday the IDF said it had **reinstated** the Gaza ceasefire.

The Israeli military published footage of what it said were members of Hamas **reburying** a body in order to “stage a false discovery” for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which it said was Hamas “attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies”.

The news has enraged Israelis, with the far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich **lashing** out at Hamas and calling on Netanyahu to resume the war.

The militant group has said it does not know the precise **whereabouts** of all the bodies.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/israel-remains-hostages-gaza-hamas

On Saturday night, Moran Harari urged Israel to **have restraint**.

It is unclear if the Palestinians were **recovered** from Gaza by troops during the war.

Israel’s prime minister said earlier on Sunday that “there are still **pockets** of Hamas” in parts of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces.

Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the first phase of the UN-**endorsed** Gaza ceasefire plan is close to completion.

The Israeli prime minister said he would discuss the next steps later this month in Washington with Donald Trump, whose Gaza proposals were **codified** in a UN security council resolution on 17 November.

Netanyahu dismisses the warrants as “**trumped**-up charges” from a “corrupt prosecutor”.

“I think it’s important to make sure that Hamas complies not only with the ceasefire, but also with their commitment which they **undertook** to disarm and have Gaza demilitarise,” he said.

He stressed that Israel was **adamantly** opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state.

Netanyahu said the reason he would not be able make a return visit to Germany was the ICC arrest warrants, which he described as **fabricated** by the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, as a means of diverting attention from allegations of sexual harassment against him.

Another **tribunal**, the international court of justice, is weighing up charges that Israeli has committed genocide in Gaza.
