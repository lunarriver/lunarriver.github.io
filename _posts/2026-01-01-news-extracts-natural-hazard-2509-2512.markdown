#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/super-typhoon-ragasa-update-path-hong-kong-taiwan-china

The outer **rim** of Super Typhoon Ragasa has been bearing down on Taiwan since Monday as its path moves down towards the southern Chinese coast.

The barrier lake, formed by landslides triggered by earlier heavy rain in Taiwan’s east, burst its banks mid-afternoon on Tuesday, unleashing a wall of water into the Guangfu **township**.

Ragasa had already toppled trees, torn the roofs off buildings and killed at least two people while **ripping** through the northern Philippines, where thousands sought shelter in schools and evacuation centres.

An AFP reporter saw waves nearly five metres high smash into the seaside **promenade** of Hong Kong’s Heng Fa Chuen residential district around nightfall.

Ragasa – named after the Filipino word for rapid motion – is expected to make **landfall** in the central and western coastal areas of Guangdong within 24 hours, the province’s emergency management bureau said on Tuesday morning.

Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, later ordered **mandatory** evacuation orders for Port Royal in Kingston and six other vulnerable areas across the country including Old Harbour Bay.

In its increasingly grim **updates**, the **hurricane** centre warned that extensive damage to infrastructure, power and communication outages and the isolation of communities in Jamaica were to be expected.

Some residents in the small fishing village of Port Royal, one of Jamaica’s most exposed and vulnerable communities, refused to **heed** official advice to leave their homes and take cover in shelters.

Residents such as Ann Marie Chamberlain, 51, decided to **ride out** the storm at home. She said villagers were confident they had done everything necessary to **avert** danger, adding: “Father God will protect us.”

All the boats have been pulled up, the roofs with **zinc** have been **battened** down … we are taking the necessary precautions.

Females weren’t safe, and **to top it off** people stole our stuff.

“We don’t have any **gullies** or river to burst its banks. If a little water come up it’s maybe a few but by the time the rain ends it disappears.”

The **erratic** and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and one person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.

Local authorities have organised lines to distribute **food kits**.

It also downed trees and traffic lights, set off a series of small **landslides** and left more than two dozen communities isolated by flood waters.

The Bahamas department of meteorology said Melissa could bring **tropical** storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the south-east and central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.

The strongest hurricane is set to make landfall early on Tuesday and to **linger** over the island.

The storm is expected to slice diagonally across the island, entering near the **parish** of St Elizabeth parish in the south.

“Catastrophic **flash flooding** and numerous landslides are likely.”

“We hope that will **suffice** for any surge that will take place”.

“If you are living in a low-lying area, **sort out** yourself and move out to the best shelter.”

“Jamaicans are very deep in their faith. And I don’t say that as a means of **mockery**.”

He said critical infrastructure was located along the coast in Kingston, where the **storm surge** was expected.

Holness announced late on Sunday that he had signed a **compulsory** evacuation order for several communities along the south coast.

Before a 1692 earthquake **submerged** most of Port Royal, it was one of the biggest cities in the Caribbean.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/hurricane-melissa-hits-cuba-after-turning-jamaica-into-disaster-area

Hurricane Melissa has torn through the Caribbean, slamming into Cuba while leaving parts of neighbouring Jamaica broken and **reeling** from ferocious winds and extreme rainfall.

The effects of the **colossal** hurricane were felt across the region.

The most intense tropical **cyclone** to hit Jamaica in nearly two centuries, Melissa is one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes observed since record-keeping began.

The prime minister has declared the country a disaster area, giving authorities extra powers such as preventing **price gouging**.

Photos showed a tree ripped out of the ground by the roots and roads submerged by **gravel** and earth.

The city’s streets were **strewn** with the **detritus** the hurricane left in its **wake**.

The roof of her shop and **adjoining** house was blown off. “It was terrible… In one of the rooms everything **caved in**.”

“I am **overwhelmed** by the situation,” he added, as he pleaded with the government to help rescue victims.

Cuba’s president said on Wednesday that Melissa had **wreaked** “extensive damage” after it made landfall overnight on the island country’s southern coast.

Many Caribbean leaders have called on rich, heavy-polluting governments to provide **reparations** in the form of aid or debt relief to tropical island countries.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/30/hurricane-melissa-bermuda-leaving-devastation-jamaica

Residents in Bermuda had remained calm as the storm was expected to give the island a relatively wide **berth**. Authorities said they would close its **causeway** Thursday night and shut schools and **ferries** on Friday “out of an **abundance** of caution”.

The British government said on Thursday that it was **chartering** flights to the island.

Hurricane Melissa has been intensely destructive, estimated to have caused billions of dollars, but accurate **forecasting** and government advice meant many people who were able to reach shelters were protected.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/philippines-state-of-emergency-typhoon-kalmaegi-death-toll

Marcos’s “state of national **calamity**” declaration would allow the government to disburse emergency funds faster and prevent food **hoarding** and overpricing.

The problems may have been made worse by years of **quarrying** that caused clogging of nearby rivers.

A corruption scandal involving **substandard** or non-existent flood control projects across the Philippines has sparked public outrage and street protests in recent months.

Ferries and fishing boats were prohibited from **venturing** out to increasingly rough seas during the typhoon.

The super-typhoon crossed over the north of the archipelago’s most populous island, Luzon, with **torrential rain**, sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) and **gusts** of up to 140mph (225km/h).

Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) or higher are categorised in the Philippines as a super-typhoon, a designation adopted to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather **disturbances**.

Warmer oceans allow typhoons to strengthen rapidly and a warmer atmosphere holds more **moisture**, meaning heavier rainfall.

More than 1.2 million people have been **pre-emptively** evacuated across the country.

Earlier on Sunday, Catanduanes was already being **lashed** by wind and rain, with storm surges sending waves **hurtling** over streets and flood waters rising in some areas.

In Guinobatan, a town of about 80,000 people in Albay province, verified video showed streets transformed into **raging torrents**.

Pope Leo **offered prayers** for the predominantly Catholic nation. “I pray for the **deceased** and their families, for the injured and the displaced,” he said on Sunday.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/10/super-typhoon-fung-wong-philippines

More than 1.4 million people were evacuated across the country as the storm triggered flash flooding, storm surges, landslides and **gale-force** winds. Deadly **mudslides** had killed least six people across the country.

Having a second typhoon hit so soon after Kalmaegi may have worsened the destruction, as torrential rain fell upon already **soaked** and destabilised soils. In northern Luzon, where mudslides killed a number of children, civil defence authorities said the ground had already been **saturated** by heavy rains.

From a **skyscraper** in downtown Manila, a sea of white spreads out below, expanding down **arterial** roads and **sidestreets**. The slogan “transparency for a better democracy” **emblazoned** on their chests.

Billions of dollars in flood mitigation funds have **evaporated**. Organised by the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), a powerful **sect** in the Philippines, the three-day rally has shut down schools, roads and offices. Families have journeyed from across the country to set up camp, some equipped with **portable** stoves and rice cookers, many of them **bearing placards** saying “expose the **deeds**”.

The focus of the fury is on government officials accused of **pocketing** billions in funds for substandard or nonexistent flood protection projects. Since the scandal began, the country’s economic planning minister has said up to 70% of public funds **allotted** for flood control may have been lost to corruption.

The absence of those protections is **felt keenly** in the Philippines.

But the hundreds of thousands gathered in Rizal Park could **spell trouble** for Marcos. The rally has been organised and endorsed by the INC, a Philippine **megachurch** that commands a membership of close to 3 million.

In the years since their election, however, Marcos and Duterte have turned from allies to **feuding** political rivals.

“It is not our aim to bring down the government as an **institution**,” he said.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/indonesia-mount-semeru-erupts-prompting-evacuations-and-highest-alert-level

The volcano in East Java province unleashed **searing** clouds of hot ash and a mixture of rock, **lava** and gas that travelled up to 7km (4 miles) down its slopes several times from midday to **dusk**, while a thick column of hot clouds rose 2km into the air, Indonesia’s **Geology** Agency said in a statement.

He said increased activity of the volcano on Wednesday afternoon prompted authorities to widen the danger zone to 8km (5 miles) from the **crater**.

Residents, some with faces **smeared** with volcanic dust and rain, fled to temporary shelters or left for other safe areas.

The group included 137 climbers, 15 **porters**, seven guides and six tourism officials.

Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 280 million people, sits along the Pacific “ring of fire”, a horseshoe-shaped series of **fault lines**, and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity.

Sri Lanka and Indonesia have deployed military personnel as they race to help victims of **devastating** flooding.

Millions of people have been affected by a combination of tropical cyclones and heavy **monsoon** rains in Sri Lanka.

The flooding has submerged homes, **inundated** agricultural fields. Some people **clung** to trees or stood on rooftops.

By Sunday afternoon, rain had **subsided** across Sri Lanka.

Military helicopters have been deployed to **airlift** stranded people and deliver food.

He said solar **lamps** were being distributed.

Extreme rainfall from tropical cyclones has increased **substantially**, as warmer air holds more water **vapour**.

In Aceh, one of the hardest hit areas, prices have **tripled**.

The World Health Organization said it was strengthening disease **surveillance**.

Survivors have described how powerful **currents** of water arrived rapidly and submerged villages.

“There was no prior warning whatsoever before the water came,” said a student at an Islamic **boarding school**.

This year’s **downpours** were **compounded** by a rare tropical storm formed in the Malacca Strait.
