### Middle East

#### [2025-03-16 US says airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen will continue indefinitely](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/16/us-says-airstrikes-against-houthis-in-yemen-will-continue-indefinitely)

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, told Fox News: “The minute the Houthis say ‘we’ll stop shooting at your ships, we’ll stop shooting at your drones’, this campaign will end, but until then it will be **unrelenting**.”

In a statement shared by state media, Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the strikes on Yemen as a “**gross** violation of the principles of the United Nations charter and the fundamental rules of international law”.

The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the US government had “no authority, or business, **dictating** Iranian foreign policy”.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday called for “utmost restraint and a **cessation** of all military activities” in Yemen.

#### [2025-03-17 Donald Trump: Iran will be held responsible for Houthi attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/17/donald-trump-iran-will-be-held-responsible-for-houthi-attacks)

 Airstrikes killed at least 53 people this weekend and appear **poised** to continue. Meanwhile, Iran continues to weigh how to respond to a letter Trump sent it last week trying to **jump-start** negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear programme.

“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim’ of **rogue** terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control,” Trump alleged in his post.

It is unclear what sparked Trump’s post. However, the head of Iran’s **paramilitary** Revolutionary Guards sought to separate the Houthis’ actions from those of Tehran this weekend.

#### [2025-05-20 Israel still blocking aid for Gaza despite promise to lift siege, says UN](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/20/israel-still-blocking-aid-for-gaza-despite-promise-to-lift-siege-says-un)

Only five trucks of aid had reached Gaza by Tuesday afternoon and aid workers had not been given permission to distribute even that **token** shipment, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office (Ocha) told a Geneva press briefing.

“A **sane** country doesn’t engage in fighting against civilians, doesn’t kill babies as a hobby and doesn’t set the expulsion of a population as a goal,” he said.

Netanyahu attacked Golan’s comments as “**contemptible** antisemitic blood **libels** against IDF soldiers and the state of Israel”, but Golan later doubled down on his position in a press conference.

“While peaceful demonstrators are dragged before the courts, rightwing extremist **settlers** are allowed to enter Gaza illegally, carry out attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and hold settlement conferences on the Gaza border with full impunity, revealing a dangerous double standard in the state’s use of force,” Standing Together said in a statement.

Israel earlier in the week issued evacuation orders for all of central Khan Younis, the second largest city in the Strip, declaring it a “combat zone”, and ordering its exhausted and hungry **inhabitants** to displace themselves again.

#### [2025-06-13 Israel launches strikes on ‘dozens’ of sites in Iran, targeting nuclear programme](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/israel-strikes-iran-nuclear-program-netanyahu)

“In the enemy’s attacks, several commanders and scientists were **martyred**.

Justifying the attack, Netanyahu said Iran was not only building up its supply of **fissile** enriched *uranium, with enough for nine warheads, but also that it had taken unprecedented steps towards building bombs.

The Democratic senator Chris Murphy said Israel’s decision to act unilaterally was a **measure** of Trump’s weakness on the world stage.

“Israel’s attack on Iran, clearly intended to **scuttle** the Trump administration’s negotiations with Iran, risks a regional war that will likely be catastrophic for America and is further evidence of how little respect world powers – including our own allies – have for President Trump,” Murphy said.

#### [2025-06-15 Israel and Iran broaden strikes during third day of escalating war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/israel-hits-iran-energy-defence-ministry-conflict-escalates)

“Iran will pay a very heavy price for the **premeditated** murder of civilians, women and children,” the prime minister said.

#### [2025-06-16 Israel issues Tehran evacuation order as Iran threatens to leave nuclear weapons treaty | Iran's nuclear programme](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/16/iran-threatens-to-leave-nuclear-weapons-treaty-as-israeli-bombing-enters-fourth-day)

In another sign of the changing targets of the Israeli offensive, Iran’s state TV announced on Monday evening that it was under attack during a live **transmission**.

Netanyahu later said killing Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, would “end the conflict” in what would be another **ominous** escalation.

There was no sign on Monday of Israel **contemplating** a pause.

Israel’s defence minister, meanwhile, threatened further bombing strikes on Tehran, where an **exodus** of residents has been reported, **clogging** roads out of the capital.

The Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, announced on Monday that Iran’s parliament, the Majlis, was preparing a bill that would withdraw the country from the 1968 NPT agreement, which **obliges** it to **forego** nuclear weapons and to undergo international inspections to verify **compliance**.

He pointed out that Ali Khamenei, had issued a religious **edict** against weapons of mass destruction.

It is seeking to maintain its **monopoly** with airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, claiming that Tehran was close to building a bomb.

Such tankers allow warplanes to refuel in mid-air and enable more **sorties** a day in wartime.

#### [2025-06-18 Israeli strikes have not knocked out Iran’s nuclear programme - or its nuclear ambitions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/israels-gamble-on-force-could-push-iran-to-accelerate-nuclear-plans)

================================================================================================================================================

It has been a powerful display of Israeli military and intelligence dominance, but has not critically damaged Iran’s widely dispersed and heavily protected nuclear programme, Israeli military commanders and international nuclear **proliferation** experts agree.

And far from curbing nuclear proliferation, Israel’s gamble on force could drive Iran to speed up its efforts to get a bomb if the current conflict ends without full destruction of the programme or a deal with **iron-clad** controls and broad inspection powers.

But US intelligence officials believe Tehran was up to three years away from being able to deliver a weapon and not actively pursuing a bomb, CNN reported on Tuesday – which would make that delay relatively **inconsequential**.

What the attacks have achieved is to **stir** up fear among the Iranian leadership and anger among Iran’s population. The hatred many Iranians **harbour** for their own government did not blunt the horror of a missile strike that killed dozens of children in their homes, and Israeli orders to evacuate entire neighbourhoods evoked the **grim** **spectre** of Gaza’s fate.

Israel developed its own nuclear arsenal as a deterrent, though it has never officially acknowledged what is an open secret. Many in Iran are convinced they need the same, and this war will probably have mitigated public **resentment** of the cost of those advances.

After the collapse over the past year of regional proxies that had served as the regime’s defensive shield, there was a greater focus inside Iran on the possibility of a nuclear programme, according to Sima Shine, Iran **specialist** and former head of research at Israel’s the Mossad intelligence agency.

It houses centrifuges and much of the country’s highly enriched uranium, and the only bombs that might be able to destroy it are the US’s most powerful **bunker-busting** munitions.

Amid Israeli **euphoria** at the impact of the first strikes, national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi warned the Israel Defense Forces cannot dismantle Iran’s nuclear programme alone.

“It cannot be done via **kinetic** means,” he told Israeli media. The military can instead create conditions for a long-term deal, brokered by the US that would totally block Iran’s nuclear programme, added.

“We underestimate the **psychological** impact of the Gaza war, including on Iranians who hate the government,” said Vali Nasr, professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University.

“Gaza also has a bad, **vicious** government that has been used as justification for action against it. Israel has shown a kind of willingness to kill at will, especially civilians.”

“There was a belief that the international liberal order would keep Israel in check, that Europe and the US would not tolerate Israel using its military might with abandon,” Nasr said. Confidence in any capacity to restrain was **blown apart** in the rubble of Gaza.

“There has always been a **fixation** in Israel and in the world with bombing the nuclear sites. Even if it is impossible to destroy Fordow from the air, other methods exist,” said Alex Grinberg, an analyst and former Iran researcher in the IDF intelligence research division.

Israel’s capture of much of an extensive nuclear archive likely gave it access to plans for Fordow, which could make it easier to **cripple** support systems, block access or even send in special forces to destroy the plant in a ground operation.

Last year Israel sent special forces **commandos** to destroy an underground Hezbollah missile factory deep inside Syria.

#### [2025-06-18 Trump undecided on joining war on Iran as Khamenei warns him not to attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/iran-threatens-us-with-irreparable-damage-if-trump-joins-war)

Donald Trump said he had not decided whether or not to take his country into Israel’s new war, as Iran’s supreme leader said the US would face “**irreparable** damage” if it deployed its military to attack.

That lack of clarity about what comes next may extend to the president himself, who was still in **deal-making** mode, one ally said. The US is understood to want to keep all its options open to **exert** maximum pressure on Tehran.

It was moving air tankers for **midair** refuelling to Spain and Greece, where they could be used to supply B-2 bombers on a long run from the Whiteman airbase in Missouri to Iran.

Iran sent a message that it was willing to negotiate a deal with the US, but Israel needed to “**calm things down**”, a source told the Jerusalem Post.

Trump’s claim that Iranians had offered to come to the White House for talks prompted an **enraged** response from Iran’s mission to the UN. “No Iranian official has ever asked to **grovel** at the gates of the White House,” the mission posted on a social media account.

Final confirmation from Tehran is still **pending**, but if confirmed it would represent the first face-to-face diplomatic meeting since the crisis began.

“A **tornado** is sweeping through Tehran,” he wrote in a post on X. “Symbols of power are being bombed and collapsing, from the broadcasting authority and soon other targets, and masses of residents are fleeing. This is how dictatorships collapse.”

The escalating conflict has prompted a growing international **chorus** of concern. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, offered to mediate between Iran and Israel, after one of his top diplomats urged Washington not to consider “**speculative** options” for intervention.

Iran is thought to still have a **substantial** **proportion** of the estimated 2,000 missiles that were in its arsenal at the start of the war. Israeli strikes have focused on launcher systems that are needed to fire them.

#### [2025-06-19 Israel’s attack has exposed Iran’s lack of firepower](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/israels-attack-has-exposed-irans-lack-of-firepower-but-conflict-could-yet-turn-in-tehrans-favour)

Israel has been able to achieve **superiority** over Iran’s skies at extraordinary speed, within hours of launching its surprise assault.

In response, Iran’s most effective weapon has been its stock of high-speed ballistic missiles, estimated at about 2,000 by Israel’s Defense Force (IDF) at the **outset** of hostilities last week. But the **heavy targeting** by Israel of launch sites in western Iran, in underground bases such as at Kermanshah – **coupled with** Israel’s **grimly** effective targeted killing of Iran’s top military commanders – have left Iran struggling to respond militarily and presenting a significant threat.

The **sheer** speed of ballistic missiles makes them dangerous weapons and a number – about 10% – continue to evade Israel’s sophisticated air defences, including a strike on the Soroka Medical Center in the southern city of Beersheba on Thursday that wounded 76. But the munitions mostly do not appear to be effectively targeted at Israel’s military-industrial complex, **aside from** an attack on the refinery at Haifa in northern Israel on Sunday that led to the shutting down of the facilities there.

Intercepting ballistic missiles is primarily the task of Israel’s newest air defence system, Arrow 3, which have a 1,500-mile range and can knock out incoming missiles beyond the Earth’s atmosphere, and its predecessor Arrow 2, though the US has been providing help with a Thaad system and destroyers based in the eastern **Mediterranean**.

A key question, however, is how many interceptors does Israel’s military have available – worries **compounded** by a report in the Wall Street Journal, which cited an anonymous US official as saying that Israel was running low.

The country’s jets face almost no air defence threat as they fly over western and central Iran – Israel has so far acknowledged the loss of one drone – meaning they are able to target sites in the country with apparent **impunity**.

Iran’s capabilities have been “exposed as **inefficient**”, **concluded** the missile analyst Fabian Hinz in a paper for the International Institute of Strategic Studies, while the “Israeli leadership, at least for the time being, is accepting the risks of ballistic missile strikes on its population centres”. As Hinz puts it, the “deterrence balance” between the two countries is **unravelling** – and it may only change back in Tehran’s favour if a suddenly a greater number or higher proportion of its remaining ballistic missiles strike population centres or key sites in Israel. There is no sign of that yet.

#### [2025-06-20 Fear and shock in Iran: ‘I’m constantly afraid a missile might hit my home’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/fear-iran-war-tehran-kerman)

It was very difficult to get out because **gasoline** was **rationed** – each person is allowed only 25 **litres** – and at every gas station we had to beg and **plead** to get more fuel.

Many food products are no longer as easily available as before – for example, fruit that used to be brought in from other provinces – because no truck drivers are willing to travel on **intercity** roads. Rice, chicken, meat and fruit have doubled in price.

**Dairy** products have gone up by 20% but all of these items are still available, just with less variety than before. However, I know that the situation in Tehran is much worse.

Due to **business closures**, there is also a high chance we won’t receive our salaries. My next fear is the high cost of living and not having enough money.

Our situation in Iran is very complicated. Many people oppose the regime. For years we have been **striving** to change this government but the government arrests, suppresses and executes us.

#### [2025-07-09 Gaza aid workers overwhelmed by ‘mass casualty incidents’ at food distribution sites](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/09/gaza-aid-workers-overwhelmed-by-mass-casualty-incidents-at-food-distribution-sites)

Medical officials, humanitarian workers and doctors in Gaza say they have been **overwhelmed** by almost daily “mass casualty incidents” as they struggle to deal with those wounded by Israeli fire on Palestinians seeking aid.

Others have been injured as huge crowds form around **convoys** sent into Gaza by the UN, many of which are stopped and **looted**.

“The scenes are truly shocking – they **resemble** the horrors of judgment day.

“Every bed is occupied by a patient, and these additional injuries place an unimaginable burden on us. We are forced to treat patients on the floor of the emergency department … Most of these injuries are gunshot wounds to the chest and head … Patients are arriving with **amputated** legs and arms,” Saqr told the Guardian.

Since the launch of the new aid distribution system, which Israel insists is necessary to prevent Hamas **diverting** humanitarian assistance, the ICRC’s 60-bed field hospital in Rafah, in the south of Gaza, has treated more than 2,200 weapon-wounded patients and has registered more than 200 deaths.

“Among the wounded are toddlers, teenagers, elderly, mothers – and **overwhelmingly**, young men and boys. Most say they were simply trying to get food or aid for their families.”

One patient with severe **abdominal** wounds told Jeffrys he had been injured as he picked up a box of food at a distribution site.

There was no independent confirmation of the claim and the GHF has **strenuously** denied that any injuries were inflicted at any of its sites, blaming Israeli troops firing on Palestinians who are trying to reach the four hubs they have established in southern and central Gaza.

It said in a statement: “To date, there have been no incidents or fatalities at or in the immediate **vicinity** of any of our distribution sites during our operating hours.”

The organisation said this week it has distributed 62m meals in the territory and was “working **tirelessly** to distribute free food aid directly to the people of Gaza safely and without interference”.

The Israeli military has repeatedly said it does not target civilians, takes all **feasible** **precautions** to avoid harm to non-combatants and **abides** by international law.

“We are really struggling … We are running out of external **fixators**, which are vital for treating open **fractures**, and critical medicines including pain killers, antibiotics and **anaesthetics**. For some things, there is just zero stock,” she said.

The healthcare system in Gaza has been **decimated** during the 21-month conflict, which was triggered in October 2023 when Hamas militants launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200, mostly civilians, and taking 250 hostages.

In the **ensuing** offensive that Israel launched into Gaza, more than 57,000 Palestinians have been killed, mostly civilians, and much of the territory reduced to rubble.

Nearly half of the territory’s 36 hospitals have been put out of service and the remaining facilities are operating at a **fraction** of their usual capacity. All struggle with acute shortages of essential medical supplies and basic equipment such as **respirators**, X-ray machines, scanners or even lamps for operating theatres.

Shortages are now more **acute** than since the beginning of the war, medics told the Guardian, with a lack of fuel, which runs generators that provide almost all power, threatening an almost total shutdown of all medical services.

For 11 weeks, Israel blocked all food, medicine and other supplies from entering Gaza, accusing Hamas of diverting aid to fund its military and other activities, though the UN said its monitoring systems were robust. Since mid-May, Israel has allowed in a **trickle** of aid, including medical supplies.

On 2 July, an Israeli airstrike killed Dr Marwan al-Sultan, a **renowned** and highly experienced **cardiologist** and director of the Indonesian hospital in Gaza.

Among the healthcare workers killed in the past 50 days were three other doctors, the chief nurses of the Indonesian hospital and al-Nasser children’s hospital, one of Gaza’s most senior **midwives**, a senior radiology technician and dozens of young medical graduates and **trainee** nurses.

### India vs Pakistan

#### [2025-04-24 How has India reacted to attack in Kashmir and why are tensions in region so high](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/24/how-has-india-reacted-to-attack-in-kashmir-and-why-are-tensions-in-region-so-high)

Tensions between the **arch-rivals** India and Pakistan have escalated rapidly after the massacre of 25 Indian tourists and a Nepalese citizen in the disputed Himalayan Kashmir region on Tuesday, prompting warnings of a return to conflict.

Among a string of punitive measures announced since Tuesday, India has downgraded diplomatic ties, suspended a crucial water-sharing treaty and revoked all visas **issued** to Pakistani nationals.

The region, in the **foothills** of the Himalayas, has been disputed since India and Pakistan **came into being** in 1947.

India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, **most recently** in 1999.

The dispute **stems from** the **partition** of colonial India in 1947, when small, **semi-autonomous** “**princely** states” across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan, and the local ruler chose to become part of India despite the fact the area had a Muslim majority.

In 2019 Narendra Modi’s government launched a severe security **crackdown** in Indian-administered Kashmir and revoked the region’s special status, which had granted it limited **autonomy** since 1949.

The move **fulfilled** a longstanding **Hindu**-nationalist pledge and was widely welcomed across India, but angered many in the territory itself. Against a backdrop of widespread **repression**, insurgent violence tapered off and tourists returned to the region.

New rules were implemented that allowed outsiders to buy land in Kashmir for the first time, which many saw as an attempt by the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) to **dispossess** them from their land and change the Muslim demography of the region.

With the new **domicile** rule, India widened who was **eligible** to live and work in Kashmir, leading to accusations that it was trying to change the demographic make-up of the region.

The attack – in the **midst** of a visit by the US vice-president, JD Vance – was highly embarrassing for Modi and his BJP party, which has been boasting since 2019 about the success of its security policies in Kashmir.

The anger in India has been exacerbated by the **sectarian** nature of the attack, during which some of the male tourists were reportedly asked to **recite** Islamic **verses** to determine who would be killed.

While some of the **bellicose** rhetoric that has been visible in the past few days is familiar from past crises between India and Pakistan that have fallen short of war, India’s decision to suspend the 1964 Indus Waters treaty is a very big deal.

Pakistani agriculture’s massive reliance on the Indus system’s waters for **irrigation** makes the treaty crucial for the country.

While much is made of the fact that both countries **retain** nuclear weapons, **conventional wisdom** is that this has tended to limit rather than exacerbate the danger of serious conflict in recent decades.

#### [2025-05-06 Pakistan decries ‘act of war’ as it retaliates against India missile attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/pakistan-vows-to-retaliate-after-wave-of-indian-missiles-hit-country)

Pakistan declared the strikes to be an “**act of war**” and claimed it had shot down five Indian air force jets and a drone. “Pakistan gives a **befitting** reply to India,” said the Pakistan government in a statement.

One Indian missile strike hit a **mosque** in the city of Bahawalpur in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, killing 13 people, including two three-year-old girls. Other locations hit were near Muridke in Punjab and Kotli in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, where a strike on a mosque killed several people, including a 16-year-old girl.

In a press conference held by the Indian army on Wednesday morning, it claimed the **overnight** strikes had targeted “terrorist training camps” and “terrorists likely to be sent across to India”, mostly associated with the Islamist militant groups Lashkar-e-Taib and Jaish-e-Mohammed.

Speaking at the press conference, Col Sudhir Chamoli **alleged** that Indian intelligence had uncovered evidence that “further attacks against India were **impending**” and said India needed to “both to deter and pre-empt”.

“These actions were measured, not escalatory, **proportionate** and responsible,” Chamoli said of the Indian strikes.

Pakistan said the strikes had been carried out from the Indian side of the border. “At no time any of their aircraft were allowed to enter into Pakistan’s airspace and also at no time, none of Pakistan’s aircraft went into Indian airspace,” said Gen Ahmed Chaudhry, the director general of Pakistan’s **inter-services** public relations, the media wing of the military.

In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, after Sharif convened a meeting of the national security council, Pakistan emphasised its right to “**avenge** the loss of innocent Pakistani lives and **blatant** violation of its sovereignty” and said the military had been authorised to take action to do so.

The missile attacks were reported at about 1am local time. Pictures shared on social media showed the bloody body of a dead child and a seriously injured adult lying on **stretchers**.

There was no immediate comment from India on the reports of the downed military aircraft. Local people reported that pieces of the aircraft were **scattered** throughout the village and there was a strong smell of jet fuel.

On Wednesday morning, police and authorities blocked access to the main area of the crash as they cleared the wreckage. Sources said the pilot had **ejected** safely and was being treated at a nearby army hospital.

The strikes, carried out as part of “Operation Sindhoor”, were met with a **chorus** of approval across political lines in India. “The world must show zero tolerance for terrorism,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, while the defence minister, Rajnath Singh, wrote on X: “Victory to Mother India”. Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the opposition Congress party, said India was “extremely proud of our Indian armed forces … We applaud their resolute **resolve** and courage”.

Several major airlines said they were suspending flights to Pakistan and over **swathes of** northern India until midday local time on Wednesday.

The escalation comes amid soaring tensions between the neighbours in the aftermath of the attack in the Baisaran Valley, a **picturesque** **meadow** in Pahalgam, a well-known tourist town in Kashmir.

Wednesday’s missile strikes are a dangerous **heightening** of tension between the south Asian neighbours, who have fought multiple wars since they were carved out of British colonial India in 1947.

#### [2025-05-10 India and Pakistan agree Kashmir ceasefire but accuse each other of breaches](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/india-pakistan-immediate-us-mediated-ceasefire)

India and Pakistan have agreed to a US-mediated ceasefire with immediate effect, though its **longevity** was thrown into question after reports of cross-border shelling and explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir just hours after it was announced.

“It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, and in the air and sea. Instructions have been given on both sides to **give effect** to this **understanding**.” The top military officials would speak again on 12 May, Misri added.

The Pakistani foreign ministry said in the early hours of Sunday that it “remains **committed to** **faithful** implementation” of the ceasefire it has agreed to with India.

“We commend prime ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, **prudence**, and **statesmanship** in choosing the path of peace,” he added.

In Uri, near the border in Indian-administered Kashmir, one of the worst-hit towns in the recent cross-border violence, Tanveer Chalko, 30, described scenes of **jubilation**.

But Lal Din, 55, a resident of Poonch, a border town in Indian-administered Kashmir where many were killed and injured in this week’s violence along the LoC, said the news of the ceasefire was **bittersweet**. His home was destroyed in cross-border shelling and two of his relatives were killed.

Historically, the US has played an important role as a mediator between India and Pakistan when hostilities have **flared** up. The Trump administration’s **proactive** role in brokering peace was, however, a notable reversal of Vance’s position 48 hours earlier, when he said the US would not intervene in the India-Pakistan conflict as it was “none of our business”.

The ceasefire appeared to give both sides the opportunity to walk away claiming victory. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and **manifestations**,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.

In Pakistan it was met with **a chorus of approval**. “Congratulations to the civil and military leadership for emerging out of the war with dignity, **professionalism** and national resolve **unequivocally** **intact**,” said the Pakistani senator Sherry Rehman.

The ceasefire came after India and Pakistan accused each other of cross-border missile strikes against significant military targets on Saturday, with many fearful it would escalate into **all-out** war.

The fighting this week was first **inflamed** on Wednesday after Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people.

The situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two **consecutive** nights of drone attacks.

#### [2025-05-14 Pakistan’s use of J-10C jets and missiles exposes potency of Chinese weaponry](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/14/pakistans-use-of-j-10c-jets-and-missiles-exposes-potency-of-chinese-arms)

As India and Pakistan **traded** missile strikes over the weekend, and the world watched with horror as the two nuclear-armed neighbours erupted into open conflict, military analysts **spotted** something curious. Pakistan, it seemed, had used Chinese jets to shoot down India’s planes.

Andrew Small, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said China gets particular benefit from seeing its weapons used against western **equivalents**. “It gives them a chance to **assess** their performance under far more complex and challenging conditions than usual, and with Pakistan this is not just about the fighter jets themselves, it’s about the missiles, the radar systems, and the whole technology spine of the Pakistani military, from electronic warfare capabilities to satellite systems.”

Hu Xijin, the former editor of the **nationalistic** Chinese state-linked tabloid Global Times, said the incident showed Taiwan should feel “even more scared”.

Part of China’s **contingency** planning is an expectation that the US military and potentially others would be involved in defending Taiwan.

The apparent success of the J-10C against the Rafales also boosts China’s **reputation** as a manufacturer and seller of weapons. While China is the world’s fourth largest arms exporter, more than half goes to Pakistan and the rest is mostly to smaller developed nations. It must work around US sanctions.

Wezeman said the shooting was too limited to draw a lot of firm conclusions about the state of China’s military, which has also been **mired** in corruption scandals in recent years.

#### [2025-05-15 India blocks X accounts of Chinese state media over coverage of Kashmir crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/15/india-blocks-x-accounts-of-chinese-state-media-over-coverage-of-kashmir-crisis)

Both China and Turkey are allies of Pakistan, with China providing the **bulk** of its weapons purchases. On Thursday, the Global Times account was restored, reportedly after a legal request.

India has targeted thousands of social media accounts in the last week, including a number of **reputable** media outlets and reporters, sparking criticism from press freedom groups.

India and Pakistan have given very different **accounts** of last week’s military clashes, in what was the worst violence between the two nuclear-armed nations in decades. Unverified reporting and propaganda has been **rife** throughout social and traditional media from both sides during the short conflict.

On Sunday, China’s government announced a new batch of “**standardised**” placenames for what it says are Chinese locations in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh – which China calls Zangnan.

The release prompted a **rebuke** from India, which called it “vain and preposterous”.

India and China, the world’s two most populous nations, have had a fractious relationship, with **occasional** military clashes of their own along a 3,800km stretch of disputed border in the Himalayas. A deadly fight between **opposing** soldiers in 2020 saw 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese soldiers killed.

#### [2025-05-20 Uneasy India-Pakistan ceasefire holds but is a return to war inevitable?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/20/uneasy-india-pakistan-ceasefire-holds-but-is-a-return-to-war-inevitable)

Against the **odds**, the ceasefire that followed India and Pakistan’s almost-war has held; fragile, uneasy but still unbroken.

There is a sense among analysts and diplomats that Delhi has not emerged from the conflict as **triumphant** as it had hoped, leaving little room for further de-escalation or political engagement.

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s army, after going through a period of **reputational** decline, is once again the country’s most **revered** institution – proving that nothing works better for the fortunes of Pakistan’s generals than an altercation with India.

He was **sceptical** that India’s missile strikes into Pakistan had done much to deter any future militant attacks, which India’s defence minister said would be taken as an “act of war”.

While India is seen to have achieved some tactical victories – successfully targeting known militant bases in Pakistan, firing targeted missiles into Rawalpindi, the heart of Pakistan’s military and largely **rebuffing** Pakistani missiles – the strategic wins have been more **elusive**.

Instead, India is now grappling with some more uncomfortable outcomes. As noted by Pratap Bhanu Mehta, an Indian political scientist, in his Indian Express column, the armed conflict has “no decisive victory and no clear political end simply **reinstates** the India-Pakistan **hyphenation**” – a reference to an age-old **tendency** to lump the two countries together as a **singular** **quarrelling** entity on the international stage. In recent years, as India soared ahead of Pakistan and positioned itself as a global economic and geopolitical superpower, there was a feeling in the corridors of New Delhi that they had broken free of the hyphenation **burden**. However, recent events showed that **perceptions**, particularly in the US, had not changed much.

The deep-rooted **instinct** of the Modi government to tightly control the flow of information (Modi has not done an in-person press conference in 10 years) meant that as Operation Sindhoor was launched, their accounts of the operation were limited to a few brief, highly **choreographed** press conferences led by civil servants.

In Pakistan meanwhile, ministers were at the end of the phone and on TV news shows **non-stop**, briefing the world constantly on the Pakistani version of events, such as claims that Pakistan had downed five Indian military jets.

Amid vast information gaps left by the Indian government an unprecedented amount of misinformation and disinformation **proliferated**. False claims fuelled an **insatiable** appetite for war among the Indian public.

As a result, on 10 May, when Donald Trump **abruptly** announced a ceasefire before India or Pakistan had a chance, it was met with a widespread reaction of betrayal and anger in India. Many could not understand why the government would agree to a ceasefire, let alone one that seemed to have been imposed by the US. The fury among the hyper-nationalist far right – Modi’s political base and where much of the disinformation originated – was particularly **potent** and the **clamour** for a return to war has still not entirely **dissipated**.

Trump’s boastful claims of brokering the ceasefire have been a source of frustration to New Delhi. While he joins a long line of US presidents who have been drawn into disputes between the neighbours, it is historically done far more **discreetly** and largely on terms favourable to India.

This time, India was so **infuriated** at Trump’s version of events, including that coercion over trade led both sides to lay down arms, that it openly **repudiated** several of the president’s statements.

Trump’s involvement has also resulted in another strategic upset for India: the re-internationalisation of the Kashmir issue. India’s **immovable** position is that its dispute with Pakistan over the region, which dates back to 1947, is a purely internal issue that should have no outside interference or third-party negotiation. But in **flagrant** disregard for this, Trump offered, post-ceasefire, to mediate between the two countries to find a “solution”. Pakistan **leapt at** the offer; in India it was met with **stony** silence.

But while among the political class in Islamabad there is **optimistic chatter** of post-ceasefire talks in the Gulf or London – where even Kashmir could be on the table – New Delhi has avoided the subject. “The **dilemma** is that this war does not compel negotiations. Nor is it likely to build even a **modicum** of trust that can allow a political negotiation,” wrote Mehta.

On a deeper, **existential** level, analysts say there remains little incentive on either side to de-escalate. In India, anti-Pakistan fervour has only driven up support for Modi and helped his strongman Hindu nationalist government win elections. In Pakistan, the ever-present threat of India has long been used to justify the dominating role of the military in running the country.

Bajpaee is among those who has a **pessimistic** view of any suggestion of post-conflict political dialogue between the two countries, calling that a “dead end” as both sides are “essentially talking past each other”.

#### [2025-05-28 How social media lies fuelled a rush to war between India and Pakistan](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/may/28/how-social-media-lies-fuelled-a-rush-to-war-between-india-and-pakistan)

As missiles and drones **crisscrossed** the night skies above India and Pakistan earlier this month, another invisible war was taking place.

What began as **disparate** claims on social media platforms such as X soon became a **cacophony** of declarations of India’s military might, broadcast as “breaking news” and “exclusives” on the country’s biggest news programmes.

According to these posts and reports, India had **variously** shot down multiple Pakistani jets, captured a Pakistani pilot as well as Karachi port and taken over the Pakistani city of Lahore. Another false claim was that Pakistan’s powerful military chief had been arrested and a coup had taken place. “We’ll be having breakfast in Rawalpindi tomorrow,” was a widely **reshared** post in the midst of hostilities, referring to the Pakistani city where its military is headquartered.

A ceasefire on 10 May brought the two countries back from the brink of all-out war after the latest conflict, which marked the biggest crisis in decades between the nuclear-armed rivals, and was **ignited** after militants opened fire at a beauty spot in Indian-controlled Kashmir, killing 26 people, mainly Indian tourists. India blamed Pakistan for the attack – a charge Islamabad has denied.

Yet even as military hostilities have ceased, analysts, **factcheckers** and activists have documented how a fully fledged war of disinformation took place online.

**Misinformation** and **disinformation** was also being circulated widely in Pakistan. The Pakistan government removed a ban on X shortly before the conflict broke out, and researchers found it immediately became a source of misinformation, though not on the same scale as in India.

Recycled and AI-generated footage **purportedly** showing Pakistani military victories was shared widely on social media and then amplified by both its mainstream media, respected journalists and government ministers to make fake claims such as the capture of an Indian pilot, a coup in the Indian army and Pakistani strikes wiping out India’s defences.

There were also widely circulated fake reports that a Pakistani cyber-attack had wiped out most of the Indian power grid and that Indian soldiers had raised a white flag in surrender. In particular, video game simulations proved to be a popular tool in spreading disinformation about Pakistan “**delivering** justice” against India.

A report into the social media war that surrounded the India-Pakistan conflict, released last week by the civil society organisation The London Story, detailed how X and Facebook “became **fertile** ground for the spread of war narratives, hate speech, and emotionally **manipulative** disinformation” and “drivers of nationalist **incitement**” in both countries.

While disinformation and misinformation were **rampant** on both sides, in India “the scale went beyond what we have seen before”, said Joyojeet Pal, associate professor at the school of information at the University of Michigan.

Analysts say that it is evidence of a new digital frontier in warfare, where an **onslaught** of tactical misinformation is used to manipulate the narrative and escalate tensions. Factcheckers say misinformation including the **repurposing** of old footage and widespread fake claims of military victories mirrored much of what had come out of Russia in the early days of the Russia-Ukraine war.

The Washington DC-based Centre for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), which tracked and documented the misinformation coming from both sides, warned that the weaponisation of misinformation and disinformation in the the most recent India-Pakistan conflict was “not an isolated phenomenon, but part of a broader global trend in **hybrid warfare**”.

**Fabricated** reports from India first emerged largely on X and Facebook, Naik said, often shared or reposted by verified rightwing accounts.

Video game imagery was **passed off** as real-life footage of India’s air force downing one of Pakistan’s JF-17 fighter jets, while footage from the Russian-Ukraine war was claimed to be scenes of “massive airstrikes on Pakistan”. **Doctored** AI visuals were circulated widely to show Pakistan’s defeat and visuals of a Turkish pilot was used in fabricated reports of a captured Pakistani pilot.

India’s mainstream media, which have already suffered a major loss of credibility owing to their heavy pro-government stance under Modi, are facing difficult questions. Some prominent **anchors** have already issued apologies.

Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), an Indian human rights organisation, has filed formal complaints to the broadcasting watchdog for “serious **ethical** breaches” of six of the country’s most prominent television news channels in their reporting of Operation Sindoor.

Kanchan Gupta, a senior adviser to the Indian ministry of information and broadcasting, denied any government role in the misinformation campaign. He said the government had been “very alert” to the issue of misinformation and has issued **explicit** advice to mainstream media reporting on the conflict.

“We set up a monitoring centre which operated 24-7 and **scrutinised** every bit of disinformation that could have a **cascading** impact, and a fact check was put out immediately.  Whatever was in the **ambit** of the law to stop this was done.”

Nonetheless, he emphasised that the “fog of war is **universally** accepted as a reality. It is a fact that in any conflict situation, whether **overt** or **covert** conflict, the nature of reportage tends to go **high-pitch**”.

The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia **dates back** more than a century, to when France, which occupied Cambodia until 1953, first mapped the land border.

The dispute over the border, which stretches across more than 508 miles (817km), has repeatedly erupted over the years, **fanned** by nationalist sentiment.

Tensions escalated further on Wednesday when five Thai military personnel were injured by **landmines** while on **patrol**.

Cambodia is **effectively** a one-party state.

Others note that the dispute may provide a welcome **distraction** from economic problems. Both Cambodia and Thailand are facing the prospect of a 36% US tariff from 1 August.

Paetongtarn also made **disparaging** remarks about a senior Thai military commander – undermining an institution that is very powerful in Thailand, and which has frequently intervened in politics.

Anwar Ibrahim, the prime minister of Malaysia, which now chairs the regional bloc **Association** of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), called on Thailand and Cambodia to “stand down”.

However, it is **improbable**, said Sanglee, that Asean, known for its non-interference policy, would be capable of trying to mediate the dispute – or willing to try.

“China is the only **viable** external mediator because it has direct leverage over Cambodia and also Thailand,” she added.

Thailand’s **caretaker** prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, said fighting must stop before negotiations could take place. There had been no declaration of war and conflict was not spreading into more provinces, he said on Thursday.

Hun Manet has requested the UN security council convene an urgent meeting to discuss the crisis, accusing Thailand of “**unprovoked** military aggression”.
