### Middle East

#### [2025-03-16 US says airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen will continue indefinitely](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/16/us-says-airstrikes-against-houthis-in-yemen-will-continue-indefinitely)

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, told Fox News: “The minute the Houthis say ‘we’ll stop shooting at your ships, we’ll stop shooting at your drones’, this campaign will end, but until then it will be **unrelenting**.”

In a statement shared by state media, Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the strikes on Yemen as a “**gross** violation of the principles of the United Nations charter and the fundamental rules of international law”.

The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the US government had “no authority, or business, **dictating** Iranian foreign policy”.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday called for “utmost restraint and a **cessation** of all military activities” in Yemen.

#### [2025-03-17 Donald Trump: Iran will be held responsible for Houthi attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/17/donald-trump-iran-will-be-held-responsible-for-houthi-attacks)

 Airstrikes killed at least 53 people this weekend and appear **poised** to continue. Meanwhile, Iran continues to weigh how to respond to a letter Trump sent it last week trying to **jump-start** negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear programme.

“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim’ of **rogue** terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control,” Trump alleged in his post.

It is unclear what sparked Trump’s post. However, the head of Iran’s **paramilitary** Revolutionary Guards sought to separate the Houthis’ actions from those of Tehran this weekend.

#### [2025-05-20 Israel still blocking aid for Gaza despite promise to lift siege, says UN](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/20/israel-still-blocking-aid-for-gaza-despite-promise-to-lift-siege-says-un)

Only five trucks of aid had reached Gaza by Tuesday afternoon and aid workers had not been given permission to distribute even that **token** shipment, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office (Ocha) told a Geneva press briefing.

“A **sane** country doesn’t engage in fighting against civilians, doesn’t kill babies as a hobby and doesn’t set the expulsion of a population as a goal,” he said.

Netanyahu attacked Golan’s comments as “**contemptible** antisemitic blood **libels** against IDF soldiers and the state of Israel”, but Golan later doubled down on his position in a press conference.

“While peaceful demonstrators are dragged before the courts, rightwing extremist **settlers** are allowed to enter Gaza illegally, carry out attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and hold settlement conferences on the Gaza border with full impunity, revealing a dangerous double standard in the state’s use of force,” Standing Together said in a statement.

Israel earlier in the week issued evacuation orders for all of central Khan Younis, the second largest city in the Strip, declaring it a “combat zone”, and ordering its exhausted and hungry **inhabitants** to displace themselves again.

#### [2025-06-13 Israel launches strikes on ‘dozens’ of sites in Iran, targeting nuclear programme](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/israel-strikes-iran-nuclear-program-netanyahu)

“In the enemy’s attacks, several commanders and scientists were **martyred**.

Justifying the attack, Netanyahu said Iran was not only building up its supply of **fissile** enriched *uranium, with enough for nine warheads, but also that it had taken unprecedented steps towards building bombs.

The Democratic senator Chris Murphy said Israel’s decision to act unilaterally was a **measure** of Trump’s weakness on the world stage.

“Israel’s attack on Iran, clearly intended to **scuttle** the Trump administration’s negotiations with Iran, risks a regional war that will likely be catastrophic for America and is further evidence of how little respect world powers – including our own allies – have for President Trump,” Murphy said.

#### [2025-06-15 Israel and Iran broaden strikes during third day of escalating war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/israel-hits-iran-energy-defence-ministry-conflict-escalates)

“Iran will pay a very heavy price for the **premeditated** murder of civilians, women and children,” the prime minister said.

#### [2025-06-16 Israel issues Tehran evacuation order as Iran threatens to leave nuclear weapons treaty | Iran's nuclear programme](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/16/iran-threatens-to-leave-nuclear-weapons-treaty-as-israeli-bombing-enters-fourth-day)

In another sign of the changing targets of the Israeli offensive, Iran’s state TV announced on Monday evening that it was under attack during a live **transmission**.

Netanyahu later said killing Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, would “end the conflict” in what would be another **ominous** escalation.

There was no sign on Monday of Israel **contemplating** a pause.

Israel’s defence minister, meanwhile, threatened further bombing strikes on Tehran, where an **exodus** of residents has been reported, **clogging** roads out of the capital.

The Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, announced on Monday that Iran’s parliament, the Majlis, was preparing a bill that would withdraw the country from the 1968 NPT agreement, which **obliges** it to **forego** nuclear weapons and to undergo international inspections to verify **compliance**.

He pointed out that Ali Khamenei, had issued a religious **edict** against weapons of mass destruction.

It is seeking to maintain its **monopoly** with airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, claiming that Tehran was close to building a bomb.

Such tankers allow warplanes to refuel in mid-air and enable more **sorties** a day in wartime.

#### [2025-06-18 Israeli strikes have not knocked out Iran’s nuclear programme - or its nuclear ambitions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/israels-gamble-on-force-could-push-iran-to-accelerate-nuclear-plans)

It has been a powerful display of Israeli military and intelligence dominance, but has not critically damaged Iran’s widely dispersed and heavily protected nuclear programme, Israeli military commanders and international nuclear **proliferation** experts agree.

And far from curbing nuclear proliferation, Israel’s gamble on force could drive Iran to speed up its efforts to get a bomb if the current conflict ends without full destruction of the programme or a deal with **iron-clad** controls and broad inspection powers.

But US intelligence officials believe Tehran was up to three years away from being able to deliver a weapon and not actively pursuing a bomb, CNN reported on Tuesday – which would make that delay relatively **inconsequential**.

The hatred many Iranians **harbour** for their own government did not blunt the horror of a missile strike that killed dozens of children in their homes, and Israeli orders to evacuate entire neighbourhoods evoked the **grim** **spectre** of Gaza’s fate.

Many in Iran are convinced they need the same, and this war will probably have mitigated public **resentment** of the cost of those advances.

Amid Israeli **euphoria** at the impact of the first strikes, national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi warned the Israel Defense Forces cannot dismantle Iran’s nuclear programme alone.

“It cannot be done via **kinetic** means,” he told Israeli media.

“We underestimate the **psychological** impact of the Gaza war, including on Iranians who hate the government,” said Vali Nasr, professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University.

“There has always been a **fixation** in Israel and in the world with bombing the nuclear sites.

Israel’s capture of much of an extensive nuclear archive likely gave it access to plans for Fordow, which could make it easier to **cripple** support systems, block access or even send in special forces to destroy the plant in a ground operation.

Last year Israel sent special forces **commandos** to destroy an underground Hezbollah missile factory deep inside Syria.

#### [2025-06-18 Trump undecided on joining war on Iran as Khamenei warns him not to attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/iran-threatens-us-with-irreparable-damage-if-trump-joins-war)

“No Iranian official has ever asked to **grovel** at the gates of the White House,” the mission posted on a social media account.

#### [2025-06-19 Israel’s attack has exposed Iran’s lack of firepower](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/israels-attack-has-exposed-irans-lack-of-firepower-but-conflict-could-yet-turn-in-tehrans-favour)

In response, Iran’s most effective weapon has been its stock of high-speed ballistic missiles, estimated at about 2,000 by Israel’s Defense Force (IDF) at the **outset** of hostilities last week.

The **sheer** speed of ballistic missiles makes them dangerous weapons and a number – about 10% – continue to evade Israel’s sophisticated air defences, including a strike on the Soroka Medical Center in the southern city of Beersheba on Thursday that wounded 76.

As Hinz puts it, the “deterrence balance” between the two countries is **unravelling** – and it may only change back in Tehran’s favour if a suddenly a greater number or higher proportion of its remaining ballistic missiles strike population centres or key sites in Israel. There is no sign of that yet.

#### [2025-06-20 Fear and shock in Iran: ‘I’m constantly afraid a missile might hit my home’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/fear-iran-war-tehran-kerman)

For years we have been **striving** to change this government but the government arrests, suppresses and executes us.

#### [2025-07-09 Gaza aid workers overwhelmed by ‘mass casualty incidents’ at food distribution sites](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/09/gaza-aid-workers-overwhelmed-by-mass-casualty-incidents-at-food-distribution-sites)

Others have been injured as huge crowds form around convoys sent into Gaza by the UN, many of which are stopped and **looted**.

“Patients are arriving with **amputated** legs and arms,” Saqr told the Guardian.

Since the launch of the new aid distribution system, which Israel insists is necessary to prevent Hamas **diverting** humanitarian assistance, the ICRC’s 60-bed field hospital in Rafah, in the south of Gaza, has treated more than 2,200 weapon-wounded patients and has registered more than 200 deaths.

One patient with severe **abdominal** wounds told Jeffrys he had been injured as he picked up a box of food at a distribution site.

There was no independent confirmation of the claim and the GHF has **strenuously** denied that any injuries were inflicted at any of its sites, blaming Israeli troops firing on Palestinians who are trying to reach the four hubs they have established in southern and central Gaza.

The Israeli military has repeatedly said it does not target civilians, takes all **feasible** precautions to avoid harm to non-combatants and **abides** by international law.

“We are really struggling … We are running out of external fixators, which are vital for treating open **fractures**, and critical medicines including pain killers, antibiotics and anaesthetics.” she said.

The healthcare system in Gaza has been **decimated** during the 21-month conflict, which was triggered in October 2023 when Hamas militants launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200, mostly civilians, and taking 250 hostages.

All struggle with acute shortages of essential medical supplies and basic equipment such as **respirators**, X-ray machines, scanners or even lamps for operating theatres.

Shortages are now more **acute** than since the beginning of the war, medics told the Guardian, with a lack of fuel, which runs generators that provide almost all power, threatening an almost total shutdown of all medical services.

On 2 July, an Israeli airstrike killed Dr Marwan al-Sultan, a **renowned** and highly experienced cardiologist and director of the Indonesian hospital in Gaza.

Among the healthcare workers killed in the past 50 days were three other doctors, the chief nurses of the Indonesian hospital and al-Nasser children’s hospital, one of Gaza’s most senior **midwives**, a senior radiology technician and dozens of young medical graduates and **trainee** nurses.

### India vs Pakistan

#### [2025-04-24 How has India reacted to attack in Kashmir and why are tensions in region so high](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/24/how-has-india-reacted-to-attack-in-kashmir-and-why-are-tensions-in-region-so-high)

The region, in the **foothills** of the Himalayas, has been disputed since India and Pakistan **came into being** in 1947.

 Against a backdrop of widespread **repression**, insurgent violence tapered off and tourists returned to the region.

New rules were implemented that allowed outsiders to buy land in Kashmir for the first time, which many saw as an attempt by the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) to **dispossess** them from their land and change the Muslim demography of the region.

With the new **domicile** rule, India widened who was **eligible** to live and work in Kashmir, leading to accusations that it was trying to change the demographic make-up of the region.

The anger in India has been exacerbated by the **sectarian** nature of the attack, during which some of the male tourists were reportedly asked to recite Islamic verses to determine who would be killed.

While some of the **bellicose** rhetoric that has been visible in the past few days is familiar from past crises between India and Pakistan that have fallen short of war, India’s decision to suspend the 1964 Indus Waters treaty is a very big deal.

Pakistani agriculture’s massive reliance on the Indus system’s waters for **irrigation** makes the treaty crucial for the country.

#### [2025-05-06 Pakistan decries ‘act of war’ as it retaliates against India missile attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/pakistan-vows-to-retaliate-after-wave-of-indian-missiles-hit-country)

“Pakistan gives a **befitting** reply to India,” said the Pakistan government in a statement.

Speaking at the press conference, Col Sudhir Chamoli alleged that Indian intelligence had uncovered evidence that “further attacks against India were **impending**” and said India needed to “both to deter and pre-empt”.

Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the opposition Congress party, said India was “extremely proud of our Indian armed forces … We applaud their resolute **resolve** and courage”.

The escalation comes amid soaring tensions between the neighbours in the aftermath of the attack in the Baisaran Valley, a **picturesque** **meadow** in Pahalgam, a well-known tourist town in Kashmir.

#### [2025-05-10 India and Pakistan agree Kashmir ceasefire but accuse each other of breaches](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/india-pakistan-immediate-us-mediated-ceasefire)

India and Pakistan have agreed to a US-mediated ceasefire with immediate effect, though its **longevity** was thrown into question after reports of cross-border shelling and explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir just hours after it was announced.

The Pakistani foreign ministry said in the early hours of Sunday that it “remains committed to **faithful** implementation” of the ceasefire it has agreed to with India.

“We commend prime ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, **prudence**, and **statesmanship** in choosing the path of peace,” he added.

In Uri, near the border in Indian-administered Kashmir, one of the worst-hit towns in the recent cross-border violence, Tanveer Chalko, 30, described scenes of **jubilation**.

“Congratulations to the civil and military leadership for emerging out of the war with dignity, professionalism and national resolve unequivocally **intact**,” said the Pakistani senator Sherry Rehman.

The fighting this week was first **inflamed** on Wednesday after Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people.

#### [2025-05-14 Pakistan’s use of J-10C jets and missiles exposes potency of Chinese weaponry](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/14/pakistans-use-of-j-10c-jets-and-missiles-exposes-potency-of-chinese-arms)

Part of China’s **contingency** planning is an expectation that the US military and potentially others would be involved in defending Taiwan.

#### [2025-05-15 India blocks X accounts of Chinese state media over coverage of Kashmir crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/15/india-blocks-x-accounts-of-chinese-state-media-over-coverage-of-kashmir-crisis)

Unverified reporting and propaganda has been **rife** throughout social and traditional media from both sides during the short conflict.

A deadly fight between **opposing** soldiers in 2020 saw 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese soldiers killed.

#### [2025-05-20 Uneasy India-Pakistan ceasefire holds but is a return to war inevitable?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/20/uneasy-india-pakistan-ceasefire-holds-but-is-a-return-to-war-inevitable)

Against the **odds**, the ceasefire that followed India and Pakistan’s almost-war has held; fragile, uneasy but still unbroken.

While India is seen to have achieved some tactical victories – successfully targeting known militant bases in Pakistan, firing targeted missiles into Rawalpindi, the heart of Pakistan’s military and largely rebuffing Pakistani missiles – the strategic wins have been more **elusive**.

As noted by Pratap Bhanu Mehta, an Indian political scientist, in his Indian Express column, the armed conflict has “no decisive victory and no clear political end simply reinstates the India-Pakistan **hyphenation**” – a reference to an age-old tendency to lump the two countries together as a singular quarrelling entity on the international stage. However, recent events showed that **perceptions**, particularly in the US, had not changed much.

The deep-rooted **instinct** of the Modi government to tightly control the flow of information (Modi has not done an in-person press conference in 10 years) meant that as Operation Sindhoor was launched, their accounts of the operation were limited to a few brief, highly **choreographed** press conferences led by civil servants.

False claims fuelled an **insatiable** appetite for war among the Indian public.

The fury among the hyper-nationalist far right – Modi’s political base and where much of the disinformation originated – was particularly **potent** and the **clamour** for a return to war has still not entirely **dissipated**.

While he joins a long line of US presidents who have been drawn into disputes between the neighbours, it is historically done far more **discreetly** and largely on terms favourable to India.

This time, India was so infuriated at Trump’s version of events, including that coercion over trade led both sides to lay down arms, that it openly **repudiated** several of the president’s statements.

Pakistan **leapt at** the offer; in India it was met with **stony** silence.

But while among the political class in Islamabad there is optimistic **chatter** of post-ceasefire talks in the Gulf or London – where even Kashmir could be on the table – New Delhi has avoided the subject. “The dilemma is that this war does not compel negotiations. Nor is it likely to build even a **modicum** of trust that can allow a political negotiation,” wrote Mehta.

On a deeper, **existential** level, analysts say there remains little incentive on either side to de-escalate.

Bajpaee is among those who has a **pessimistic** view of any suggestion of post-conflict political dialogue between the two countries, calling that a “dead end” as both sides are “essentially talking past each other”.

#### [2025-05-28 How social media lies fuelled a rush to war between India and Pakistan](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/may/28/how-social-media-lies-fuelled-a-rush-to-war-between-india-and-pakistan)

What began as **disparate** claims on social media platforms such as X soon became a **cacophony** of declarations of India’s military might, broadcast as “breaking news” and “exclusives” on the country’s biggest news programmes.

A report into the social media war that surrounded the India-Pakistan conflict, released last week by the civil society organisation The London Story, detailed how X and Facebook “became **fertile** ground for the spread of war narratives, hate speech, and emotionally manipulative disinformation” and “drivers of nationalist incitement” in both countries.

Video game imagery was **passed off** as real-life footage of India’s air force downing one of Pakistan’s JF-17 fighter jets, while footage from the Russian-Ukraine war was claimed to be scenes of “massive airstrikes on Pakistan”. **Doctored** AI visuals were circulated widely to show Pakistan’s defeat and visuals of a Turkish pilot was used in fabricated reports of a captured Pakistani pilot.

Some prominent **anchors** have already issued apologies.

Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), an Indian human rights organisation, has filed formal complaints to the broadcasting watchdog for “serious **ethical** breaches” of six of the country’s most prominent television news channels in their reporting of Operation Sindoor.

Whatever was in the **ambit** of the law to stop this was done.

### Others

#### [2025-07-24 Why are Thailand and Cambodia engaged in a border conflict?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/24/why-thailand-cambodia-border-clash-conflict)

Others note that the dispute may provide a welcome **distraction** from economic problems.

Paetongtarn also made **disparaging** remarks about a senior Thai military commander – undermining an institution that is very powerful in Thailand, and which has frequently intervened in politics.

However, it is **improbable**, said Sanglee, that Asean, known for its non-interference policy, would be capable of trying to mediate the dispute – or willing to try.
