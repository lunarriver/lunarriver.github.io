#### [2025-06-01 Ukraine launches major drone attack on Russian bombers, security official says](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/01/ukraine-launches-major-drone-attack-on-russian-bombers-security-official-says)

Ukraine has launched a “large-scale” drone attack against Russian military **bombers** in Siberia, striking more than 40 warplanes thousands of miles from its own territory, a security official has said, after it **smuggled** the drones to the **perimeter** of the airfields hidden in the roofs of wooden **sheds**.

On the eve of peace talks, the drone attack on four separate airfields was part of a sharp ramping up of the three-year war, with Russia launching waves of drones at Ukraine, while Moscow said sabotage was to blame for two train derailments that left seven people dead.

Video from several military airfields across Russia showed destroyed aircraft and planes **engulfed** in flames, though the full extent of the damage remained unclear.

Among the more than 40 aircraft reportedly hit were Tu-95 and Tu-22 strategic bombers, which Russia uses to fire long-range missiles at Ukrainian cities.

Ukraine’s SBU domestic intelligence agency said it had hit Russian military planes worth a **combined** $7bn (£5.2bn) in the wave of drone strikes.

If the extent of the damage is confirmed, the attack would mark Ukraine’s most damaging drone strike of the war to date, amid an escalation in cross-border incursions before a new round of direct negotiations in Istanbul on Monday.

A Ukrainian official provided video footage to media reportedly showing the strikes, in which Reuters said several large aircraft that appeared to be Tu-95 bombers were on fire. The Tu-95 was originally developed to carry nuclear bombs and now launches cruise missiles.

Several Russian and Ukrainian media outlets reported that Ukraine carried out the operation by launching drones from lorries parked near military airfields deep inside Russia.

Ukrainian officials told the media that the operation – codename “Spiderweb” – had been in preparation for more than 18 months. The drones were first smuggled into Russia and later **concealed** under the roofs of small wooden sheds which were loaded on to trucks and driven to the perimeter of the airbases. The roof panels of the sheds were lifted off by a remotely activated mechanism, allowing the drones to fly out and begin their attack, the official said.

Media reports said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had personally **overseen** the sophisticated operation.

On Sunday evening he thanked everyone involved, adding: “We had been preparing the operation for more than a year and a half. Planning, organisation, all the details were perfectly prepared. I can say for sure that this is a completely unique operation.”

He said that the office of Ukraine’s operation in Russia had been located “right next to the FSB office in one of (Russia’s) regions”.

“In total, 117 drones were used in the operation. And a corresponding number of drone operators were working,” he said. “Thirty-four per cent of the strategic cruise missile carriers at the airfields were hit. Our people were operating in different Russian regions – in three time zones. And our people were withdrawn from the territory of Russia on the eve of the operation, and now they are safe – those who helped us.”

Photographs from Ukrainian security officials showed dozens of short-range **quadcopter** drones piled up in an industrial facility. Other images showed the wooden sheds with their metal roofing panels removed, and the drones sitting in the **cavities** between roof **beams**.

A separate video posted on Russian Telegram channels appeared to show matching sheds on the back of a truck with the roof panels lying on the ground and at least two drones rising out of the top of the sheds and flying off.

Mash, a Telegram channel with links to Russia’s security services, published footage that appeared to show men in Siberia’s Irkutsk region climbing on to one of the lorries in an attempt to prevent drones from launching.

In one clip, filmed at the burning airbase in Olenegorsk in the Murmansk region, a Russian service person is heard saying: “It’s fucked here,” as several bombers burn in the background.

Since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022, Ukraine has been **chronically** outgunned by Russia in terms of military firepower. But it has developed a **nimble** and **sizeable** fleet of attack drones used to strike Russia’s army and energy infrastructure.

The Belaya airbase targeted on Sunday in Irkutsk oblast is more than 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Ukraine.

The Russian defence ministry confirmed that several of its military aircraft “caught fire” in the attack in the regions of Murmansk and Irkutsk. It added that there were no casualties and that several “participants” had been arrested.

In March, Ukraine said it had developed a new drone with a range of 3,000km, without providing further details.

Earlier on Sunday, Russian investigators said they believed “explosions” had caused two bridges in the border regions of Kursk and Bryansk to collapse overnight, derailing trains and killing at least seven people and injuring dozens. No one has claimed responsibility.

Russian investigators were investigating the bridge blasts as “acts of terrorism”, according to state media. The Kremlin said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had been briefed throughout the night.

Separately, tracks on the Unecha-Zhecha section of railway in Russia’s Bryansk region were damaged without casualties, the national operator, Russian Railways, said.

Russia has been hit by dozens of sabotage attacks since Moscow launched its offensive against Ukraine in 2022, many targeting its vast railway network. Kyiv says railways are targeted because they transport troops and weaponry.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched 472 drones overnight, the highest nightly total of the war so far, as well as seven missiles. Ukraine’s army said at least 12 Ukrainian service members were killed and more than 60 were injured in a Russian missile strike on an army training unit.

Ukraine had previously refused to **commit to** attending a new round of direct talks in Turkey but on Sunday Zelenskyy said a delegation led by his defence minister, Rustem Umerov, would be in Istanbul. “I have also defined our position before the Monday meeting in Istanbul,” which includes priorities to reach “a complete and unconditional ceasefire” and the return of prisoners and abducted children, Zelenskyy said on social media.

The US president, Donald Trump, has put pressure on both sides to end the war and threatened to walk away if they do not, potentially leaving Kyiv entirely dependent on European aid.

Reuters reported Ukrainian negotiators in Istanbul would present a **proposed** plan for reaching a lasting peace settlement, with the current frontline as the starting point for negotiations about territory.

Citing a copy of the document **laying out** the Ukrainian position, it said there would be no future restrictions on Ukraine’s military strength, no international recognition of Russian sovereignty over parts of Ukraine taken by Moscow’s forces, and **reparations** for Ukraine.

Last year, Putin set out his opening **terms** for an immediate end to the war, demanding Ukraine drop its Nato membership ambitions and withdraw all of its troops from all four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia.

#### [2025-06-01 China accuses Pete Hegseth of sowing division in Asia in speech ‘filled with provocations’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/01/china-accuses-pete-hegseth-of-sowing-division-in-asia-in-speech-filled-with-provocations)

China’s government has accused Pete Hegseth of trying to “sow division” in the Asia Pacific region over his speech at a Singapore defence conference where he warned China was a potentially “imminent” threat.

On Saturday Hegseth said China was “**credibly** preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific”, and was rehearsing for “the **real deal**” of invading Taiwan.

“There’s no reason to **sugar coat** it. The threat China **poses** is real, and it could be imminent,” the US defence secretary said in a keynote address at the Shangri-la Dialogue defence forum, calling for Asian countries to increase defence spending.

On Sunday, China’s ministry of foreign affairs condemned his words, which it said were “filled with provocations and intended to sow division”.

“Hegseth deliberately ignored the call for peace and development by countries in the region, and instead touted the cold war mentality for bloc confrontation, **vilified** China with **defamatory** allegations, and falsely called China a ‘threat’,” it said.

“The remarks were filled with provocations and intended to sow division. China deplores and firmly opposes them and has protested strongly to the US.”

The statement also pushed back at Hegseth’s claim that China was trying to become a “hegemonic power” in the region.

“No country in the world deserves to be called a hegemonic power other than the US itself, who is also the primary factor undermining the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific,” it said.

The ministry accused Hegseth of “playing with fire” with what it calls “the Taiwan question”. China’s ruling Communist party (CCP) claims Taiwan is a province of China, illegally run by separatists, and has vowed to annex it. Taiwan’s democratically elected government and the majority of its people reject the prospect of CCP rule.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday morning, Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, rejected the **premise** of China’s criticism of Hegseth.

“What we have seen from China is the single biggest increase in military capability and buildup in a **conventional sense** by any country since the end of the second world war,” he said.

“That is one of the key features of the **complexity** of the strategic landscape which all of us face within the region and which is faced around the world.”

Marles said Australia had worked with regional partners including the US and the Philippines “over a long period of time to uphold the global rules-based order”, including freedom of navigation operations to assert the UN convention on the law of the sea.

The US is not a **signatory** to that convention.

The Shangri-la Dialogue is an annual conference that hosts dozens of leaders, defence ministers and military chiefs from around the world, for three days of panel discussions and speeches. But much of the significant interactions occur on the sidelines, with private meetings between representatives. Past years have often seen the US and China trade **barbs**, but also occasionally hold significant meetings, including last year with China’s defence minister, Dong Jun, and Hegseth’s predecessor, Lloyd Austin.

This year, however, China sent only a small delegation led by a vice-president of the People’s Liberation Army’s national defence university, **Rear Adm** Hu Gangfeng.

On Saturday afternoon Hu told a panel, which included the head of the British armed forces, that speakers had attempted to “provoke, split and instigate confrontations in the region” with criticisms of China.

He said the maritime situation in the region was “generally stable” but faced “severe challenges”, and accused unnamed countries of increasing military presences and infringing on territorial sovereignty of others “in the name of so-called freedom of navigation” and supporting “Taiwan independence separatist forces”.

China claims much of the South China Sea, where there are overlapping claims of sovereignty among several countries. It has rejected a ruling by The Hague that its claims are unlawful.

Later on Sunday, Singapore’s defence minister, Chan Chun Sing, told a panel that it was crucial China and the world properly understand each other. Referencing China’s absence, Chan said Beijing should use “every opportunity” available to **get** its position **across**.

“But **regardless of** whether China attends the dialogue, it is **incumbent** on all of us to reach out to China in different forums … to not end up in a situation where either side **misinterprets**, miscalculates, or **misrepresents** each other’s position. That is dangerous.”

#### [2025-06-03 Lee Jae-myung wins election as South Korean president](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/03/lee-jae-myung-elected-as-south-korean-president-exit-polls-say)

Liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung has won the vote to become South Korea’s new president after a **snap election** triggered by a brief period of martial law imposed by the now-impeached former leader, Yoon Suk Yeol.

With 100% of the ballots counted, Lee won 49.42% of nearly 35 million **votes cast**, while his conservative rival Kim Moon-soo had taken 41.15%, according to national election commission data, which said **turnout** was the highest for a presidential election since 1997.

Speaking outside his home, Lee thanked voters for placing their trust in him.

“I will do my utmost to fulfil the great responsibility and mission entrusted to me, so as not to disappoint the expectations of our people,” he told reporters. He said he would not forget the duty of a president to unite the people.

Lee, a 61-year-old former human rights lawyer who had made two failed attempts to become president, rode a wave of public anger that followed Yoon’s declaration of martial law in early December.

The order, which was overturned in **a matter of** hours, sparked South Korea’s biggest political crisis in decades. The country is also battling an economic downturn, income inequality and doubts over the US’s commitment to its security under Donald Trump.

Kim, however, struggled to win over moderate swing voters while his People Power party **feuded** over how to view Yoon’s legacy.

Turnout was high, at 77.8% an hour before the polls closed, surpassing the figure recorded in the previous presidential election in 2022, according to the national election commission. More than a third of the 44.39 million eligible voters had cast their ballots in early voting last Thursday and Friday.

Some South Koreans view the election, called after the constitutional court upheld Yoon’s impeachment in early April, as evidence that their democracy is in good health. In a Facebook message on Tuesday, Lee had cast the election as voters’ opportunity to “save South Korea, which is in crisis due to the greed of the establishment”.

But the division unleashed by Yoon is expected to follow Lee into his single five-year term, which begins on Wednesday without the traditional two-month transition period.

Large crowds have taken to the streets in recent months to denounce or support Yoon, whose suspension, and then removal, left a leadership vacuum that shook the country’s diplomatic activities and financial markets.

“The economy has gotten so much worse since December … Not just for me but I hear that from everybody,” said Kim Kwang-ma, an 81-year-old voter. “And we as a people have become so **polarised** … I wish we could come together so that Korea can develop again.”

Lee, a **frontrunner** since the start of the campaign, will face several major challenges, including a slowing economy, Trump’s trade war and the nuclear threat posed by North Korea.

In his final campaign speeches on Monday, Lee promised to revitalise the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions.

Kim, a former labour minister under Yoon, warned that a **victorious** Lee would abuse his powers to retaliate against his political opponents and use his party’s majority in the national assembly to protect him in several court cases that will resume after the election.

Lee “is now trying to seize all power in South Korea and establish a Hitler-like dictatorship”, Kim told a rally in the south-eastern city of Busan.

Lee, who headed the opposition-led campaign to oust Yoon, is a highly **divisive** figure in South Korean politics. He faces criminal trials including charges of bribery and alleged involvement in a property development scandal.

Courts agreed to postpone further hearings of continuing trials until after the election, allowing him to contest the presidency while the cases remained unresolved. Lee denies all charges, describing them as politically motivated persecution.

Lee, who grew up in a poor household and worked in factories as a child, has shown a more cautious side in recent speeches, despite his reputation as a radical reformer determined to take on the country’s conservative establishment.

He has promised to be pragmatic in foreign affairs, committing himself to South Korea’s alliance with the US and vowing to continue Seoul’s partnership with Washington and Tokyo, mirroring the policies of his conservative predecessor.

But he wants to move away from Yoon’s **confrontational** approach towards North Korea and re-engage with the South’s nuclear-armed neighbour. He has conceded, though, that it will be “very difficult” to quickly resume summits with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un.

#### [2025-06-04 World won’t forget Tiananmen Square, US and Taiwan say on 36th anniversary of massacre](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/04/world-wont-forget-tiananmen-square-us-and-taiwan-say-on-36th-anniversary-of-massacre)

The world will never forget the Tiananmen Square massacre, the US secretary of state and Taiwan president have said on the 36th anniversary of the crackdown, which China’s government still tries to erase from domestic memory.

There is no official death toll but activists believe hundreds, possibly thousands, were killed by China’s People’s Liberation Army in the streets around Tiananmen Square, Beijing’s central plaza, on 4 June 1989.

“Today we commemorate the **bravery** of the Chinese people who were killed as they tried to exercise their fundamental freedoms, as well as those who continue to suffer persecution as they seek accountability and justice for the events of June 4, 1989,” said Marco Rubio, the US’s top diplomat, in a statement.

“The Chinese Communist party actively tries to censor the facts, but the world will never forget.”

In a Facebook post, Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, also praised the bravery of the protesters.

“Authoritarian governments often choose to silence and forget history, while democratic societies choose to preserve the truth and refuse to forget those who gave their lives – and their dreams – to the idea of human rights,” Lai said.

Ahead of the 1989 massacre protesters had been gathering for weeks in the square to call for democratic reforms to the CCP. The student-led movement attracted worldwide attention, which turned to horror as tanks rolled into the square to clear the encampment. Several protesters were also killed at a smaller demonstration in Chengdu, a city in south-west China.

The date of 4 June remains one of China’s strictest **taboos**, and the Chinese government employs extensive and increasingly sophisticated resources to censor any discussion or acknowledgment of it inside China. Internet censors scrub even the most obscure references to the date from online spaces, and activists in China are often put under increased surveillance or sent on enforced “holidays” away from Beijing.

New research from human rights workers has found that the sensitive date also sees heightened **transnational** **repression** of Chinese government critics overseas by the government and its proxies.

The report published on Wednesday by Article 19, a human rights research and **advocacy** group, said that the Chinese government “has engaged in a systematic international campaign of transnational repression targeting protesters critical of the Chinese Communist party,” with Uyghurs, Tibetans and Hongkongers particularly likely to be affected.

The report cited Freedom House research in 2023, which found that China had been responsible for about 30% all recorded acts of physical transnational repression since 2014.

“Protesters targeted by transnational repression frequently live in fear of surveillance; targeting; abduction and forced **repatriation**, especially around embassies and consulates; and ‘collective punishment’ retaliation against relatives still in China, which also leads people to cut ties with their family,” the report said.

The Article 19 researchers found that, with Tiananmen Square **vigils** **snuffed** out in China, pro-CCP agents appear to be targeting commemorations in other parts of the world.

In 2022, a **replica** of a statue known as the “Pillar of Shame”, by Danish artist Jens Galschiøt, was **vandalised** in Taipei. The statue is designed to memorialise the people who died on 4 June 1989. The original was on display at the University of Hong Kong for 23 years before it was removed by university authorities in 2021.

For many years, Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent Macau, were the only places on Chinese territory where the event could be commemorated.

But since the 2019 pro-democracy protests and the **ensuing** crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, the annual 4 June vigil in Victoria Park has been banned. In recent years some high profile activists have been **prosecuted** over attempts to mark the day. For the last three years a government-sponsored food **carnival** has been held on the site during the week of the anniversary.

On Tuesday there was a heavy police presence in Causeway Bay, near the park, Hong Kong Free Press reported. A performance artist, Chan Mei-tung, was stopped and searched, and later **escorted** from the area by police. She was standing on the road chewing gum, according to the outlet. In 2022 Chan was arrested on after she stood in the same area peeling a potato.

On Tuesday Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, warned that any activity conducted on Wednesday must be “lawful”, but was not specific. A key criticism of Hong Kong’s national security laws are that they are broad and the **proscribed** crimes are ill-defined.

One of the few groups of people in China who are still outspoken about the events of 36 years ago are the rapidly ageing “Tiananmen Mothers”, parents of young people killed in the massacre, who have called for an official **reckoning**.

One of the founding members, 88-year-old Zhang Xianling, gave a rare interview this year with Radio Free Asia, saying that she still lives under close surveillance. Zhang said: “I don’t know why they are so afraid of me. I am 88 years old and I have to use a wheelchair if I can’t walk 200 metres. Am I that scary?”

Earlier this week Li Xiaoming, an ex-PLA officer who has lived in Australia for 25 years, gave an interview to Taiwan media, about his involvement at the Tiananmen crackdown as a junior soldier. Li said he was **compelled** to talk “as a warning to the world”, and also to Taiwan which is facing the threat of Chinese annexation.

“Although the CCP leadership sees the 4 June incident as something shameful, what they learned from it is the need for strict control – eliminating any sign of unrest early on, controlling and blocking public opinion, and brainwashing to people. They work to crush all **instability** at the earliest stage,” he said according to CNA’s translation.
