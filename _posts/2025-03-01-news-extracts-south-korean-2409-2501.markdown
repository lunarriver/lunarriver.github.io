Yoon has already made an impression with Washington’s leaders, after his **rendition** of the Don McLean song American Pie at a state dinner with Joe Biden in 2023.

The countries **clashed** over cost-sharing for the roughly 28,500 US troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war.

Tokyo was treated the same as Seoul in **contentious** talks on military cost-sharing, he added.

South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, on Tuesday declared martial law, **blasting** the opposition as “anti-state forces” threatening the country’s democracy.

A six-point **decree** comes from the new martial law commander.

The president’s move **harkened** back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s. It was immediately **denounced** by the opposition and the leader of Yoon’s own party.

While unexpected, the announcement came in the context of a **festering** budget row between Yoon and the opposition Democratic Party.

The opposition has **slashed** around 4.1 trillion won ($2.8 billion) from Yoon’s proposed 677 trillion won budget for next year.

But 190 lawmakers managed to enter, voting **unanimously** to reject Yoon’s declaration and calling for martial law to be lifted.

Some protesters **scuffled** with troops but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage.

The White House said it was “**relieved**” that Yoon had reversed course on his declaration of martial law.

The feeling in South Korea has been one of **bafflement** and sadness.

**Expedited** impeachment is the word on people’s lips.

A motion to impeach the South Korean president over his ill-fated declaration of martial law this week has failed after members of his party **boycotted** the vote.

The dramatic **walkout** meant uncertainty surrounds Yoon’s fate.

But the plan **unravelled** when members of the PPP filed out of the chamber just before the televised vote.

Demonstrators **booed**, and some wept in frustration, as the lawmakers walked out on Saturday.

He **rescinded** the martial law order.

The turmoil resulting from Yoon’s **stunt** has sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners.

His wife, Kim Keon-hee has proved to be his greatest political **liability**.

The president’s party refused to impeach him over his **botched** declaration of martial law last week.

It was the **culmination** of a presidency that had been troubled from the start.

When he narrowly won the election in March 2022, Yoon was already a **divisive** figure.

But his presidency was quickly **beset** by scandal, with his approval ratings hovering at about 35% for the past two years.

Families of victims accused authorities of trying to shift blame by suggesting drug use among victims, while **stonewalling** calls for an independent inquiry.

Yoon’s administration launched aggressive attacks over **unfavourable** coverage, and launching a torrent of **defamation** suits.

what had started as inexperience in politics was beginning to look more like systematic democratic **backsliding**.

Many are part of a generation shaped by national traumas such as the Sewol **ferry** disaster and the Itaewon crush.

Special forces troops breaking windows to enter parliament provided dramatic scenes that **galvanised** public outrage.

For the older generation who lived through military dictatorship, the nightmares of the past were **unmistakable**.

The ruling People Power party offered him a **dignified** exit when the first impeachment vote failed last weekend owing to their boycott.

For a former prosecutor who helped bring down ex-president Park Geun-hye through impeachment in 2017, it is a remarkable **reversal** of fortune.
