Yoon has already made an impression with Washington’s leaders, after his **rendition** of the Don McLean song American Pie at a state dinner with Joe Biden in 2023.

South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, on Tuesday declared martial law, **blasting** the opposition as “anti-state forces” threatening the country’s democracy.

A six-point **decree** comes from the new martial law commander.

The president’s move **harkened** back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s. It was immediately **denounced** by the opposition and the leader of Yoon’s own party.

While unexpected, the announcement came in the context of a **festering** budget row between Yoon and the opposition Democratic Party.

The opposition has **slashed** around 4.1 trillion won ($2.8 billion) from Yoon’s proposed 677 trillion won budget for next year.

But 190 lawmakers managed to enter, voting **unanimously** to reject Yoon’s declaration and calling for martial law to be lifted.

Some protesters **scuffled** with troops but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage.

The White House said it was “**relieved**” that Yoon had reversed course on his declaration of martial law.

The feeling in South Korea has been one of **bafflement** and sadness.

**Expedited** impeachment is the word on people’s lips.

Demonstrators **booed**, and some wept in frustration, as the lawmakers walked out on Saturday.

His wife, Kim Keon-hee has proved to be his greatest political **liability**.

Yoon has vetoed three separate bills seeking to establish a special **counsel** to investigate his wife.

PPP lawmakers began leaving as soon as the first vote **concluded**.
