#### [2024-10-07 Israel marks 7 October with memorials and protests, as attacks on Lebanon and Gaza continue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/07/october-7-anniversary-israel-memorial-protests-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah-attack)

Large fireballs lit the darkened skyline and booms **reverberated** across Beirut.

Families of hostages still held in Gaza gathered near prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence and stood during a two-minute siren, **replicating** a custom from Holocaust Remembrance and Memorial Day.

The **memorials** came as the region awaited Israel’s response to an unprecedented missile attacks from Iran last week.

#### [2024-10-09 Republicans threaten to punish colleges that allow pro-Palestinian protests](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/republicans-crackdown-universities-pro-palestinian-protests)

Top Republicans are threatening to **strip** them of official **accreditation** to punish them for allowing pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses.

Scalise outlined how he planned to **unleash** a massive attack against universities that fail to squash criticism of Israel.

The event was ostensibly billed as a discussion on the spread of **antisemitism**.

The **fall-out** continues to roil campuses and cities throughout the US.

There was no attempt during the hour-long conversation to distinguish **hatred** of Jews from pro-Palestinian or anti-Israeli government sentiments.

It has a $100m war **chest** to spend on the election this year.

This summer Aipac invested $23m in **unseating** in primary contests two core members of the progressive Democratic group.

“That’s **accountability**, by the way,” Scalise added. 

He told Aipac that a second Trump administration would **wield** federal purse strings to punish the schools.

You have a lot of **jurisdiction** as president.

Scalise singled out Harvard, which have been **rattled** by the controversy over student protests around the Gaza war.

Columbia’s president Minouche Shafik stepped down in August after also facing criticism over her handling of pro-Palestinian protest **encampments**.

The congressman went on to **denigrate** Jewish students who engage in pro-Palestinian protest, saying they “just feel guilty that they’re alive.”

Part of the Republicans’ gameplan is to use House **oversight** powers to investigate colleges for alleged civil rights violations.

The education department could **decertify** accrediting agencies that pursue liberal policies towards campus speech and favour agencies that follow a more **draconian** approach.

In his **manifesto** for a return to the White House, Agenda47, he says that “our secret weapon will be the college accreditation system”.

He pledges that once back in the White House, “I will fire the radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and **lunatics**.” 

Were it passed, it would give universities an **ultimatum**: remove protest encampments from campus grounds within seven days, or lose all federal funding.

#### [2024-10-09 At least 400,000 people trapped by Israel’s latest Gaza offensive, says Unrwa](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/at-least-400000-people-trapped-by-israels-latest-gaza-offensive-says-unrwa)

This recent military operation also threatens the implementation of the second phase of the **polio** **vaccination** campaign for children.

Despite **intermittent** declarations by the IDF and other officials claiming to have defeated Hamas, Israeli tanks and infantry attacked northern Gaza for a third time.

The Hamas **affiliated** TV channel al-Aqsa said on Telegram that one of its photojournalists was killed in an attack in Jabalia.

An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the **morgue**.

#### [2024-10-17 Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in surprise encounter with Israeli forces](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/israeli-military-says-it-may-have-killed-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar)

The war is still ongoing, and it’s **costly**.

Graphic photos and video from the scene showed what appeared to be Sinwar’s body, wearing **fatigues**, with two severe head injuries and a leg injury.

Channel 12 reported that Sinwar had been hiding with the six hostages whose bodies were recovered by the IDF in August after they were killed by their **captors** as Israeli troops approached.

Israel has **spared** no resources in its year-long hunt for Sinwar, engaging a taskforce of intelligence officers, special operation units, military engineers and surveillance experts.

Various western and Israeli intelligence assessments over the past year have suggested that Sinwar has long **shunned** electronic communication, relying on a network of **couriers** to exchange messages.

Those reports also said Sinwar had become “**fatalistic**” after 12 months of intense warfare, but still hoping to **ensnare** Israel in a regional battle with Iran.

Sinwar received a **bachelor’s** degree in Arabic Studies at the Islamic University of Gaz.

Mohammed Dahlan is an influential member of the **secular** Fatah party now living in exile in the UAE.

He was **instrumental** in building the group’s military capabilities.

In 1989, he was sentenced to four life sentences for the **abduction** and killing of two Israeli soldiers.

After the 2021 war between Hamas and Israel, he posed for photographs, **grinning**, on an armchair amid the ruins of his house.

Unlike some senior Hamas leaders, he never **wavered** from a belief that armed struggle is the only way to end the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.

He was estimated to have left a few days before Israeli forces raided the **bunker**.

Israeli officials have suggested before that Sinwar has been killed, particularly after long stretches in which the leader went **incommunicado**.

The Forum **commends** the security forces for eliminating Sinwar, who masterminded the greatest massacre our country has ever faced.

#### [2024-10-22 Blinken meets Netanyahu in renewed US push for Gaza ceasefire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/22/antony-blinken-visits-israel-in-renewed-us-push-for-gaza-ceasefire)

Blinken, who has made multiple **fruitless** trips to the region, arrived to little evidence that either Israel or Hamas were open to movement on their preconditions for a ceasefire in Gaza.

With war **raging** in the area, international diplomats have struggled with how to sequence issues related to the connected conflicts.

The state department said before the visit that Blinken would focus on **alleviating** the suffering of Palestinian civilians.

There has been a suggestion from Egypt, a key **interlocutor** with Hamas, of a much-truncated ceasefire-for-hostages deal.

Blinken’s arrival **follows hard on the heels** of that of the US special envoy, Amos Hochstein.

The Biden administration could be forced by US law to **curtail** some forms of military aid.

The US, Egypt and Qatar have **brokered** months of talks between Israel and Hama.

Iran’s foreign minister has been **crisscrossing** the region in recent days to try to build support.

Gulf Arab nations such as the UAE and Qatar host major military **installations**.

Adding **impetus** to the calls for progress on a ceasefire on Tuesday was the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency.

#### [2024-10-23 Four in 10 deaths in war zones last year were women, UN report finds](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/23/un-women-report-civilian-deaths-children-war-zones-2023-access-healthcare)

The deliberate targeting of women’s rights is not unique to conflict-affected countries but is even more lethal in those **settings**.

The UN agency said most victims were unable to access medical care in the first 72 hours after being raped, including emergency **contraception**.

#### [2024-10-25 Israel must stop ‘ethnic cleansing’ in Gaza, Jordan tells US](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/25/israel-jordan-foreign-minister-ayman-safadi-stop-ethnic-cleansing-gaza)

We do see ethnic **cleansing** taking place, and that has got to stop.

Resolution 1701 calls for the **disarmament** of non-state groups in Lebanon – including Hezbollah – and for a full Israeli withdrawal from the country.

The US believes that if Hezbollah can be weakened further the political deadlock that prevents the **formation** of a full government can be broken.

### 真主党和胡塞

#### [2024-09-24 Israeli strikes on Lebanon continue as Iran says Hezbollah ‘cannot stand alone’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/24/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-united-nations)

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, told a UN security council meeting that “hell is **breaking loose**” in Lebanon.

The US and UK’s “unwavering support for Israel has given them **carte** blanche for all sorts of **sinister** behaviour”.

But US diplomats indicated an unconditional ceasefire call in the form of a joint security council statement could be seen as accepting a **moral** equivalence between the behaviour of Israel and Hezbollah.

The proposal for a temporary three-week **cessation** of hostilities might provide a platform to reopen stalled talks on the discussions over a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.

The war must end with a comprehensive **undertaking** that has real implementation mechanisms.

#### [2024-09-26 France and US push for 21-day Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire in Lebanon as UN chief warns ‘hell is breaking loose’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/26/lebanon-temporary-ceasefire-plan-hezbollah-israel)

 On Tuesday Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, expressed fears of a regional **conflagration**.

The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, described the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as almost a “full-**fledged** war”.

Many experts and officials question the **assumption** that air power or other military operations can achieve such strategic aims.

In Lebanon, displaced families slept in shelters **hastily** set up in schools in Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon.

Some people waited for hours in **gridlocked** traffic to get to what they hoped would be safety.

Issa Baydoun fled the village of Shihine in southern Lebanon when it was bombed and came to Beirut in a **convoy** of cars with his extended family.

He rejected Israel’s **contention** that it hit only military targets.

Israel and some analysts have said that Hezbollah has deliberately stored missiles and other **armaments** in homes or other civilian buildings.

#### [2024-10-21 Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon hit branches of Hezbollah-linked bank](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)

Blinken will also address improvements in humanitarian aid access to Gaza, which the US said could result in **reductions** in arms supplies to Israel if aid continues to be prevented from reaching the **beleaguered** strip.

The strikes were part of what Israel said were efforts to **dismantle** Hezbollah’s financial system.

If this gold is destroyed, Hezbollah’s **constituents** expect that it will be able to compensate them for their loss.

Israel gave its conditions for a ceasefire to Washington last week in a document that included **amendments** to resolution 1701.

Lebanese officials are likely to reject the new demands, which would be seen as **encroaching** on the country’s sovereignty.

#### [2024-10-24 Macron warns Netanyahu against ‘sowing barbarism’ in remarks on Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/macron-opens-conference-ceasefire-lebanon-israel)

The total far **outstrips** both France’s target of €500m ($540m) and the $400m originally requested by the UN for Lebanon.

We have been very clear that this cannot lead, should not lead, to a **protracted** campaign.

Macron appeared to back a tougher **mandate** for the UN peacekeepers much criticised by Israel.

That in turn might provide the space to secure a majority in the Lebanese parliament to elect a new president, ending a two-year **impasse** caused by divisions largely on ethnic grounds.

#### [2024-10-27 Iran says it will respond ‘appropriately’ to Israeli strikes but does not seek war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/iran-supreme-leader-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-israel-attack)

It is not clear whether Pezeshkian was indicating that Iran would **contemplate** a direct military response.

The US has said it is concerned that the cycle of **tit-for-tat** strikes between the Middle East’s largest military powers could lead to a full-scale regional war.

The “evil committed by the Zionist regime two nights ago should neither be **downplayed** nor **exaggerated**”.

The Islamic Republic of Iran, in alignment with the principles **enshrined** in the Charter of the United Nations and under international law, reserves its inherent right to legal and legitimate response to these criminal attacks at the appropriate time.

Israel’s attack destroyed air defence systems set up to protect several critical oil and petrochemical **refineries** and a large gasfield.

The west should move away from its outdated and dangerous **paradigm**. It must condemn Israel’s recent acts of aggression and join Iran in efforts to end the **apartheid**, genocide and violence in Palestine and Gaza, and in Lebanon.

Iran’s mission to the UN in New York accused the US of being **complicit** in the attack.

It is really **remarkable** that it took place at this international level.

#### [2024-12-19 Israel launches deadly air raids against Yemen after missile attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/19/israel-launches-deadly-air-raids-against-yemen-after-missile-attack)

There had been reports **beforehand** that Israel was planning to hit Yemen with force.

An Israeli strike had destroyed a **tugboat** but the port had several others capable of **towing** ships to the **dock**.

The Israel Defense Forces issued a statement accusing the Houthis of “conducting attacks against Israel in **contravention** of international law”.

The American-Israeli bombings of civilian facilities in Yemen **expose** the **hypocrisy** of the west.

Iran condemned the Israeli strikes in Yemen as a “**flagrant** violation of the principles and norms of international law and the UN charter”.
