#### [2024-10-09 At least 400,000 people trapped by Israel’s latest Gaza offensive, says Unrwa](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/at-least-400000-people-trapped-by-israels-latest-gaza-offensive-says-unrwa)

This recent military operation also threatens the implementation of the second phase of the **polio** **vaccination** campaign for children.

Despite **intermittent** declarations by the IDF and other officials claiming to have defeated Hamas, Israeli tanks and infantry attacked northern Gaza for a third time.

The Hamas **affiliated** TV channel al-Aqsa said on Telegram that one of its photojournalists was killed in an attack in Jabalia.

An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the **morgue**.

#### [2024-10-07 Israel marks 7 October with memorials and protests, as attacks on Lebanon and Gaza continue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/07/october-7-anniversary-israel-memorial-protests-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah-attack)

Large fireballs lit the darkened skyline and booms **reverberated** across Beirut.

Families of hostages still held in Gaza gathered near prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence and stood during a two-minute siren, **replicating** a custom from Holocaust Remembrance and Memorial Day.

The **memorials** came as the region awaited Israel’s response to an unprecedented missile attacks from Iran last week.

#### [2024-10-17 Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar killed in surprise encounter with Israeli forces](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/israeli-military-says-it-may-have-killed-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar)

The war is still ongoing, and it’s **costly**.

Graphic photos and video from the scene showed what appeared to be Sinwar’s body, wearing **fatigues**, with two severe head injuries and a leg injury.

Channel 12 reported that Sinwar had been hiding with the six hostages whose bodies were recovered by the IDF in August after they were killed by their **captors** as Israeli troops approached.

Israel has **spared** no resources in its year-long hunt for Sinwar, engaging a taskforce of intelligence officers, special operation units, military engineers and surveillance experts.

Various western and Israeli intelligence assessments over the past year have suggested that Sinwar has long **shunned** electronic communication, relying on a network of **couriers** to exchange messages.

Those reports also said Sinwar had become “**fatalistic**” after 12 months of intense warfare, but still hoping to **ensnare** Israel in a regional battle with Iran.

Sinwar received a **bachelor’s** degree in Arabic Studies at the Islamic University of Gaz.

Mohammed Dahlan is an influential member of the **secular** Fatah party now living in exile in the UAE.

He was **instrumental** in building the group’s military capabilities.

In 1989, he was sentenced to four life sentences for the **abduction** and killing of two Israeli soldiers.

After the 2021 war between Hamas and Israel, he posed for photographs, **grinning**, on an armchair amid the ruins of his house.

Unlike some senior Hamas leaders, he never **wavered** from a belief that armed struggle is the only way to end the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.

He was estimated to have left a few days before Israeli forces raided the **bunker**.

Israeli officials have suggested before that Sinwar has been killed, particularly after long stretches in which the leader went **incommunicado**.

The Forum **commends** the security forces for eliminating Sinwar, who masterminded the greatest massacre our country has ever faced.
