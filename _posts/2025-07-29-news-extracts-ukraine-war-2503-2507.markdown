#### [2025-03-18 Vladimir Putin agrees to 30-day halt to attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/trump-and-putin-to-hold-high-stakes-call-on-ukraine)

Vladimir Putin has agreed to a limited ceasefire that would stop Russia targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure after a **high-stakes** phone call with Donald Trump.

But the Russian leader declined to commit to a 30-day full ceasefire, a plan pitched by Trump that Ukraine agreed to last week, **denting** the US president’s hope of bringing a quick end to hostilities.

Trump put a positive **spin** on the discussion, writing on his Truth Social platform shortly after the call ended that he had had a “very good and productive” conversation with Putin.

In his first public appearance since the call, Trump told Fox News interviewer Laura Ingraham: “And we want to **get it over with**.”

The “series of significant issues” included how such a ceasefire would be **enforced** and whether it would give Ukraine an opportunity to strengthen its forces and receive western military aid, it said.

It marked a low point in US-Ukrainian relations and **spooked** other allies that Washington may be about to abandon Kyiv.

We are very much on track,” he wrote, in language that was noticeably less **hyperbolic** than some of his pronouncements on the conflict.

Ukrainian officials say that they believe their relations with the Trump administration are now on **sounder footing**.

However, Peskov directly contradicted Trump, when speaking to reporters in Moscow: “The need to halt arms supplies to Kyiv was discussed during Putin and Trump’s conversation,” he said.

#### [2025-03-20 EU ready to impose more sanctions on Russia after summit talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/20/eu-ready-to-impose-more-sanctions-on-russia-after-summit-talks)

The show of unity was **marred** by Orbán refusing to support an EU text declaring support for Ukraine, which stated: “The European Council calls on Russia to show real political will to end the war.”

Orbán’s growing confidence in diverging from the EU on Ukraine raises questions about the bloc’s ability to impose new sanctions and renew existing ones, although diplomats **take comfort from** the fact Hungary has always **acceded** to the plans in the end.

Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy head, who led the initiative, is now calling on member states to provide 2m shells worth €5bn, a downgrade on her original plan that **envisaged** every country contributing military aid based on the size of its economy.

Spain and Italy, which both spend below the 2% Nato target on defence, say Europe cannot **overlook** other threats to security. Spain is urging a wider definition of defence spending to **encompass** cybersecurity, anti-terrorism and efforts to combat the climate crisis.

It was important, he said, “to take into account that the challenges that we face in the southern neighbourhood are a bit different to the ones the eastern **flank** face”.

#### [2025-03-23 Gulf in US and Russian expectations marks start of latest ceasefire talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/23/gulf-in-us-and-russian-expectations-marks-start-of-latest-ceasefire-talks)

This week’s talks are expected to **delve** into the details of implementing the 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure, and potentially expand into shipping in the Black Sea.

“And from that you’ll naturally **gravitate** to a full-on shooting ceasefire.”

Moscow **pulled out of** the deal in 2023, amid accusations that the west had failed to uphold its commitments to ease sanctions on Russia’s exports of farm produce and fertilisers.

Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Witkoff, a real **estate** developer who had no prior diplomatic experience before being tasked as Donald Trump’s special envoy, downplayed fears of Vladimir Putin launching a broader aggression.

The agenda is, stop the killing, stop the **carnage**. Let’s end this thing.

He dismissed Keir Starmer’s readiness to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine post-ceasefire as “a combination of a **posture** and a pose”.

I think that’s **preposterous**.

When asked about the upcoming talks, however, Witkoff said the “central issue” was the Ukrainian regions that had been annexed or partially occupied by Russian forces. He **stumbled**, however, in trying to name them.

Earlier this month, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine would not recognise any occupied territories – where Russia was accused of holding **sham** polls in 2022 in a bid to provide cover for their illegal annexation – as Russian.

Witkoff appeared to side with the Kremlin as he cited the largely discredited polls as evidence of local sentiment on the ground and **conflated** the locally spoken language with support for Russia.

He went to his local church and met with his **priest** and prayed for the president.

#### [2025-03-24 Ukraine accuses Moscow of ‘hollow statements about peace’ after latest attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/24/ukraine-accuses-moscow-of-hollow-statements-about-peace-after-latest-attack)

The US is expected to **shuttle** between the two countries to finalise details and negotiate separate measures to ensure the safety of shipping in the Black Sea.

Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump listed issues he said were on the table: “We’re talking about territory right now. We’re talking about lines of **demarcation**, talking about power, power-plant ownership.”

The **lead-up** to the talks was marked by a series of pro-Russian statements by Witkoff – **tapped** by Trump as his personal envoy to Putin – in which he appeared to legitimise Russia’s staged referendums in four Ukrainian regions.

The referendums in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces were widely rebuked in the west as illegitimate and are viewed as a thinly **veiled** attempt to justify Russia’s illegal annexation of the regions.

“I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war and all the **ingredients** that led up to it,” he added.

#### [2025-03-26 Russian strikes show Moscow does not want ‘real peace’, says Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/26/russian-ukraine-drone-strikes-zelenskyy-peace)

“We are satisfied with how pragmatically and constructively our dialogue is developing and by how it is **yielding** results,” he said.

A list of Russian and Ukrainian targets to be covered by the energy **moratorium** had been agreed with the help of US negotiators.

Together they are trying to **stitch** together a “reassurance force” to provide security to Ukraine in the event of a negotiated **armistice** or peace.

Details about who will participate and the size of the force have been **sparse** with speculation that it could contain 10,000 to 30,000 troops plus fighter jet **policing** to secure Ukraine’s air space, as well as maritime patrols de-mining the Black Sea to protect grain exports.

Donald Trump has been pressing for a full end to the fighting in Ukraine, declaring on the campaign trail before his election that he could end the war in 24 hours, though earlier this month he described his own statement as “a little bit **sarcastic**”.

Ukraine’s strategy is to engage constructively in the talks, showing it is ready to agree to intermediate ceasefire proposals, and switch the **onus** on peace to Russia in the belief the Kremlin will raise more pre-conditions.

Kim, whose material support for Putin could earn North Korea access to Russian satellite and military technology to boost its nuclear missile programme, said a **monument** would soon be built in the capital, Pyongyang, to honour his soldiers’ “battle **feats**”.

“The two countries agreed to disclose the deployment because they judged that the benefits of compensation for the troop deployment **outweighed** the potential damage to their international image,” Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told Agence France-Presse.

“North Korea likely aimed to **showcase** that victory was achieved thanks to their involvement, thereby securing greater rewards from Russia,” he added.

#### [2025-05-07 Xi Jinping to begin four-day Russia visit after Ukrainian drones attack Moscow](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/07/xi-jinping-begins-russia-visit-china-ukrainian-drones-moscow)

Xi Jinping is flying to Moscow for the start2 of a four-day visit during which he will attend Russia’s military **parade** **commemorating** the anniversary of the end of the second world war, known in Russia as Victory Day.

Aleksandar Vučić’s visit to Moscow, for which he has been heavily criticised by several major European capitals, had already faced complications after Latvia and Lithuania reportedly barred his plane from their airspace, forcing a significant **detour**.

In an article published on Wednesday, Xi wrote: “China and Russia are both major countries with significant influence and are constructive forces in maintaining global strategic stability and improving global governance … Together we must **foil** all schemes to disrupt or undermine our **bonds** of **amity** and trust”.

But in recent months Kyiv has been increasingly **outspoken** about what it says is China’s direct aid for Moscow’s war efforts.

#### [2025-05-08 Xi hails ‘confident’ China-Russia ties as Putin welcomes ‘dear friend’ to Kremlin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-china-russia-kremlin)

Xi said the Sino-Russian relationship was “confident, stable and **resilient**” in the new era and that China was willing to work with Russia to promote a multipolar world.

Xi, whose plane was escorted by Russian fighter jets, was greeted on Wednesday by a military band playing the national **anthems** of Russia and China.

On Thursday he said the world was facing “unilateralism and acts of hegemonic bullying in the international **arena**”, a veiled reference to the US-China trade war, in which China has accused the US of coercive behaviour.

Lai compared Taiwan’s current **predicament** to that of European countries before the start of the second world war.

#### [2025-05-09 China and Russia pledge to deepen ties as they criticise US on Victory Day](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/09/china-russia-ties-criticise-us-victory-day)

In a lengthy statement published during Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow for the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which Russia celebrates on 9 May as Victory Day, Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin said “certain countries … are attempting to **tamper** with the results of the victory of the second world war”.

“The United States and its allies are trying to promote Nato’s eastward expansion into the Asia-Pacific region, build ‘small circles’ in the Asia-Pacific region, and **win over** countries in the region to promote their ‘Indo-Pacific strategy’, undermining regional peace, stability and prosperity,” the statement read.

The statement also said that “unilateral coercive measures, including economic sanctions, that **bypass** the UN security council violate the UN Charter and other international laws and undermine international security interests”.

This week’s meeting of the Chinese and Russian leaders underscores the close relationship between the two men who see themselves as a **bulwark** against US hegemony.

================================================================================================================================================

Russian troops fighting in Ukraine have marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater **spectacle** than in recent years.

After several **scaled-back** Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests – Vladimir Putin on Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

“The Soviet Union **took upon** itself the most **ferocious**, **merciless** **blows** of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine.

While Putin was **presiding** over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a **tribunal** for Russian war crimes.

The Kremlin presented the **turnout** as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine.

Other guests included leaders from fellow **autocracies** and pariah regimes, such as the military **juntas** from Myanmar and Burkina Faso.

This year’s parade featured an expanded military presence, with a fleet of tanks rolling across Red Square alongside rocket launchers, TOS-2 Tosochka heavy **flamethrower** systems and Iskander ballistic missiles – all weapons used in the war in Ukraine. For the first time, several types of modern Russian-made drones were also on display, underscoring their role as a **defining** feature of the conflict.

The **showcase** of weaponry marked a **stark** contrast to 2024’s **toned-down** parade, when a single Soviet-era tank rolled through Red Square. The shift is likely to **resonate** in European capitals, where officials have grown increasingly concerned about Moscow’s ability to **replenish** its military stockpiles and increase weapons production.

Over his two-and-a-half decades in power, Victory Day has emerged as the **centrepiece** of Putin’s vision of Russian identity. But since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Kremlin’s **mass** propaganda machine has given it new meaning, with Putin using the celebrations to justify the current war.

Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to **mobilise** support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader **resurrecting** nazism in Ukraine.

Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said: “Victory Day is by far the most important celebration for Putin – it’s an **ideological** event designed to rally the nation around him.

In a speech a day earlier, Zelenskyy condemned what he called Russia’s attempt to “**appropriate** Ukraine and distort history”, accusing the Kremlin of twisting the legacy of the second world war for propaganda purposes.

“Tomorrow, the organiser of the **mass graves** in Bucha will speak of Nazi atrocities. The architects of the Mariupol siege will invoke the siege of **Leningrad**. It will be a parade of **cynicism**, **bile**, and lies,” Zelenskyy said.

At the end of April, Putin announced a three-day unilateral ceasefire in Ukraine, starting on 8 May to coincide with the commemorations. Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as **self-serving** and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected.

In the **lead-up to** Victory Day, Ukraine significantly increased its drone attacks on Moscow and surrounding regions, causing airport closures and logistical chaos.

#### [2025-05-13 Trump must realise Putin is obstacle to peace, Zelenskyy says](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/13/volodymyr-zelenskyy-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-peace-talks-turkey)


Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he hopes the current period of **frantic** diplomacy and **high-stakes** gambits between Russia and Ukraine will end with Donald Trump understanding that Vladimir Putin is the real obstacle to a peace deal.

“Trump needs to believe that Putin actually lies. And we should do our part. **Sensibly** approach this issue, to show that it’s not us that is slowing down the process,” said Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy said he had arranged to meet with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Ankara, but would be ready to fly to Istanbul **at a moment’s notice** if the Russian leader **showed up**. “If Putin does not arrive and **plays games**, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war,” he said on Tuesday.

Previously, after Putin used an unexpected **late-night** Kremlin address to call for direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Istanbul, Zelenskyy responded by saying he would be waiting for Putin personally in Turkey on Thursday.

Trump, who is on a visit to Saudi Arabia, appeared to **float the idea** of a three-way meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy, saying on Monday: “I believe the two leaders are going to be there. I was thinking about flying over.”

Zelenskyy said he was hoping Trump would **indeed** meet him in Turkey. “If Trump travels, it will push Putin also to travel,” he said. “Trump can really help. It’s the situation where the US being present can give important guarantees.”

“Our delegation will be there and will wait for the Ukrainian side,” said Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesday evening. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Russia wanted to use any talks to address the “root causes” of the conflict as Moscow sees them, including the “**denazification**” of Ukraine and the official incorporation into Russia of annexed territories – suggesting that the rhetoric of the two sides is still very far apart.

He pointed to previous talks in Saudi Arabia, when the Americans acted as intermediaries between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, and a lasting full ceasefire could not be agreed. “Without signals from the leaders, or a meeting of the leaders, this **format** doesn’t work,” he said.

However, when **pressed**, he refused to rule out sending a lower-level delegation to Istanbul for talks. “I don’t know. I am being honest. Maybe the Americans, maybe someone will really want to launch this format again. I don’t know,” he said.

The back-and-forth diplomacy began with a visit to Kyiv by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland on Saturday, timed symbolically to come just one day after a **set-piece** military parade in Moscow marking 80 years since the Soviet victory in the second world war. After speaking with Trump on the phone, the four European leaders **laid down** an ultimatum to Putin that he should sign up to a 30-day ceasefire by Monday or face further sanctions. Putin rejected the ultimatum, instead offering the Istanbul talks without a ceasefire.

“I believe that President Trump is not against imposing sanctions … and I believe that there is political will in Congress to vote for these sanctions. I believe the Americans are very close to imposing these sanctions,” he said. He added that consultations would take place in the coming days – “if you’ll allow me, I won’t say where or when” – in which Europeans would be **briefed** on upcoming US sanctions plans.

The Ukrainian president has been walking a diplomatic **tightrope** in recent weeks, as Kyiv tries to keep the Trump administration on side. After the disastrous White House meeting at the end of February, Zelenskyy appears to have had some success turning the relationship around, **culminating** in a positive meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral in the Vatican last month.

British and French officials have been speaking regularly with Ukrainian counterparts since the White House **debacle** and offering **guidance** on how to mend relations with the US administration.

“He has a very creative approach … He’s a **risk-taker**.

After his visit to Turkey, Zelenskyy is expected to visit Albania for a meeting of European politicians on Friday, and then may travel to Rome, where he suggested he could attend the **inaugural** mass of the new pope, Leo XIV, after having a positive phone call with him earlier this week.

#### [2025-05-15 Zelenskyy sends team for peace talks but says Russia ‘not serious enough’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/15/zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-istanbul)

“Unfortunately, the Russians are not serious enough about the negotiations … **Out of respect** for President Trump and Erdoğan, I have decided to send our delegation to Istanbul now,” Zelenskyy said, adding that the delegation would be headed by his defence minister, Rustem Umerov.

The talks will take place at the Dolmabahçe Palace, the grand **residence** on the European shore of the Bosphorus that hosted a fruitless round of negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv in 2022.

The much-anticipated day on Thursday **descended** into **disarray** early on with the Ukrainian and Russian delegations arriving in separate cities hundreds of miles apart, casting immediate doubt over whether they would meet at all.

**Looming over** it all was Trump, who raised doubts over the value of any talks that did not involve him and the Russian president. “Nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together,” he told reporters onboard Air Force One.

Echoing Trump, Rubio told reporters late on Thursday: “I think it’s **abundantly** clear that the only way we’re going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin.” He said any meeting between the two would depend on progress this week.

The remarks will **dampen** hopes in Kyiv and among its European allies that Trump is prepared to impose tough sanctions if the current talks collapse before he gets the chance to meet Putin – in effect leaving Moscow with little incentive to compromise in Turkey.

Speaking during a stop in Qatar on Thursday before heading to the UAE, Trump suggested he might still travel to Turkey on Friday “if something happened” at the talks. But by **nightfall** there was little sign that any **last-minute** summit involving the US president was in the works.

Zelenskyy and Putin have each been **manoeuvring** to position themselves **favourably** in front of Trump, who has grown increasingly impatient with the slow pace of the talks, with each leader **casting** the other as the main obstacle to progress.

Zelenskyy said: “I believe the most important thing for Ukraine is to remain constructive and reasonable. That’s why we’re sending a delegation led by the defence ministry – so that no one can claim Ukraine is responsible for **derailing** the talks.”

Zelenskyy had travelled to Ankara with a team of his closest aides on Thursday, while Russia’s mid-level delegation, led by Vladimir Medinsky, an **ultra-conservative**, landed earlier in the day in Istanbul, where hundreds of journalists **camped out** for hours awaiting without success the start of the talks.

Throughout the conference in Ankara, Zelenskyy sought to **frame** Russia’s choice of delegation as a sign to Trump that Moscow was not approaching the talks **in good faith**. He told reporters that the Russian delegation that arrived in Istanbul did not include “anyone who actually makes decisions”, accusing Moscow of not making efforts to end the war seriously.

But there is little evidence so far that Trump is **receptive** to Zelenskyy’s **plea**, with the US leader on Thursday refusing to criticise the Russian delegation.

Any hopes of a serious breakthrough appear to have been **dashed** by Putin’s decision not to send his two most senior diplomats, Yuri Ushakov and Sergei Lavrov, and instead delegate the talks to lower-ranking aides.

Observers say that by appointing Medinsky, a former culture minister, to lead the delegation, Putin is signalling he has little interest in genuine compromise and **remains committed to** the same objectives he pursued in 2022: **stripping** Ukraine of its sovereignty and military capability.

Medinsky, who also led the failed peace talks in March 2022, held a hastily arranged press conference at the Russian **consulate** in Istanbul.

Medinsky also echoed a **well-worn** Kremlin talking point, saying Russia aimed to address the “root causes” of the war – a phrase frequently used by Putin to justify the invasion.

Boris Bondarev, a former senior Russian diplomat who resigned after Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine, said: “Putin clearly doesn’t want any genuine peace talks, nor any ceasefire, unless it’s entirely **on his terms**.”

Bondarev said Putin had **proposed** the talks in Turkey with the aim of **convincing** Trump he was committed to peace, while he remained intent on continuing the fighting on the ground.

#### [2025-05-19 Trump and Putin hold phone call but Kremlin refuses Ukraine ceasefire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/19/trump-and-putin-hold-phone-call-but-kremlin-refuses-ukraine-ceasefire)

Trump’s statement after the call with Putin also suggested the US would be stepping back from the negotiations. He said the conditions for a deal could only be negotiated by the “**warring** parties”, despite his earlier claim that he could end the war in a single day.

Beyond Trump’s **occasionally** optimistic rhetoric, no breakthrough appears in sight. Despite previously demanding an immediate ceasefire and backing Europe’s ultimatum for Russia to halt hostilities, he now appears to be once again **easing off** pressure on Moscow. He made no mention of his previous threats to impose sanctions on Russia if it did not agree to halt the fighting.

**Crucially**, Putin repeated his longstanding **refrain** that the “root causes” of the war must be addressed: a reference to Russia’s far-reaching demands that would severely undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty.

These demands include forcing Ukraine to “denazify” and demilitarise, cutting back its armed forces, barring it from receiving western military support, and imposing **sweeping limits** on its sovereignty.

In an apparent show of confidence and **nonchalance**, Putin took the call with Trump on Monday while touring a music school in Sochi. His **bravado** is fuelled by Russia’s slow but steady battlefield gains, Europe’s **disjointed** response, and a domestic economy increasingly adapted for a prolonged war.

The Ukrainian leader also urged the US not to “distance itself from the talks and the **pursuit** of peace”.

#### [2025-05-23 Satellite images reveal damage to North Korea warship after ‘criminal’ launch accident](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/23/north-korea-ship-satellite-images-launch-accident-damage-failure-warship-destroyer)

Satellite images have revealed the extent of a navy **shipyard** accident in North Korea that resulted in serious damage to a warship and **infuriated** the country’s leader Kim Jong-un.

Images taken by satellite show the warship lying on its side, with the bow of the vessel on land, while a large portion of the **stern** lies in the water. The **stricken** ship has been covered by large blue **tarpaulins**.

Pyongyang has said the incident on Wednesday was caused by a loss of balance while the vessel was being **launched**, and sections of the bottom of the warship were crushed.

An internal inspection found that there were no holes in the warship’s bottom, but the **starboard** **hull** was **scratched** and seawater flowed into the stern section through the rescue channel, the report said.

The **mishap** likely occurred in front of a large crowd, increasing the public humiliation for Kim, military analysts said.

“The stern is seen swung out into the harbour as a result of the wheeled units placed under the frame sliding into the water while the bow remained on the side **slipway**,” said the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), citing satellite imagery.

The shipyard in Chongjin has primarily produced **cargo** vessels and fishing vessels and “undoubtedly lacks significant **expertise**” in launching large warships such as the new destroyer, CSIS added.

Treating the accident as a serious matter was part of an effort to fight against “**incautiousness**” and “**irresponsibility**,” according to KCNA.

Pyongyang has said that “a serious accident occurred” at Wednesday’s launch ceremony in the eastern port city of Chongjin for a newly built 5,000-tonne naval **destroyer**, in which sections of the bottom of the vessel were crushed.

On Friday, KCNA reported that shipyard manager Hong Kil Ho had been **summoned** by law enforcement.

Kim has ordered the ship to be restored before a ruling party meeting in June. KCNA said the **rehabilitation** plan was **pushing ahead**.

South Korea’s military said US and Seoul intelligence authorities assessed that North Korea’s “side-launch attempt” of the ship failed, and the vessel was left **listing** in the water.

KCNA, however, reported that an “underwater and internal inspection of the warship confirmed that, unlike the initial announcement, there were no holes made at the warship’s bottom”, calling the **extent** of the damage “not serious”.

Satellite imagery shows the warship, covered in blue tarpaulins, lying on its side, with the stern **swung out** into the harbour, but the bow remaining on the side slipway, according to the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Russia has **amassed** 50,000 of its troops in the Sumy region before a planned large-scale offensive.

Zelenskyy said the government in Kyiv had undertaken steps to prevent Russia from carrying out wide-scale attacks in the area that borders the Russian oblast of Kursk, where Ukrainian troops carried out a surprise **seizure** of territory last August using drones and heavy western **armaments**.

Germany’s freshly appointed chancellor received Zelenskyy in Berlin amid expectations he would announce new plans to aid Ukraine. Merz welcomed Zelenskyy with military honours at the **chancellery** building in the German capital.

Berlin is one of Kyiv’s main backers, a **course** that Merz, who came into office last month, has promised to continue.

This would enable Kyiv to defend itself more effectively without Berlin having to be concerned about being labelled a “war **monger**”. This in turn would make support for Ukraine more palatable to Merz’s domestic **audience**, among whom there is concern about Germany being dragged into a wider-scale conflict.

Speaking at a security conference in Moscow, Lavrov said the announcement was **reminiscent** of “the periods of the previous century when Germany twice became the leading military power and how much trouble this brought”.

Ukraine has launched a “large-scale” drone attack against Russian military **bombers** in Siberia, striking more than 40 warplanes thousands of miles from its own territory, a security official has said, after it **smuggled** the drones to the **perimeter** of the airfields hidden in the roofs of wooden **sheds**.

Video from several military airfields across Russia showed destroyed aircraft and planes **engulfed** in flames, though the full extent of the damage remained unclear.

Ukraine’s SBU domestic intelligence agency said it had hit Russian military planes worth a **combined** $7bn (£5.2bn) in the wave of drone strikes.

The drones were first smuggled into Russia and later **concealed** under the roofs of small wooden sheds which were loaded on to trucks and driven to the perimeter of the airbases.

Media reports said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had personally **overseen** the sophisticated operation.

Photographs from Ukrainian security officials showed dozens of short-range **quadcopter** drones piled up in an industrial facility. Other images showed the wooden sheds with their metal roofing panels removed, and the drones sitting in the **cavities** between roof **beams**.

Since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022, Ukraine has been **chronically** outgunned by Russia in terms of military firepower. But it has developed a **nimble** and **sizeable** fleet of attack drones used to strike Russia’s army and energy infrastructure.

Ukraine had previously refused to **commit to** attending a new round of direct talks in Turkey but on Sunday Zelenskyy said a delegation led by his defence minister, Rustem Umerov, would be in Istanbul.

Reuters reported Ukrainian negotiators in Istanbul would present a **proposed** plan for reaching a lasting peace settlement, with the current frontline as the starting point for negotiations about territory.

Citing a copy of the document **laying out** the Ukrainian position, it said there would be no future restrictions on Ukraine’s military strength, no international recognition of Russian sovereignty over parts of Ukraine taken by Moscow’s forces, and **reparations** for Ukraine.

Last year, Putin set out his opening **terms** for an immediate end to the war, demanding Ukraine drop its Nato membership ambitions and withdraw all of its troops from all four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia.

#### [2025-06-04 Putin tells Trump Russia ‘will have to respond’ to Ukraine drone attack](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/trump-putin-conversation-ukraine-drone-attack)

The US president, who repeatedly claimed he could end the Ukraine war in 24 hours during his election campaign, did not attempt to **discourage** the Russian leader from retaliation, according to his description of the discussion on his Truth Social platform.

He noted instead that Putin had **offered to** participate in US talks with Iran about its nuclear programme, which Trump claimed Tehran had been “slowwalking”. The programme has expanded considerably since 2018, when Trump withdrew from a multilateral agreement to **constrain** it in exchange for sanctions relief.

The comments from both leaders confirmed negotiations in Istanbul on Monday had made no **headway** towards a truce, but the two sides signalled progress on other issues, including the transfer of captives and bodies.

Zelenskyy said he expected 500 **PoWs** to be swapped this weekend, but he said that the broader peace proposal put forward by Russia in Istanbul **amounted to** “an ultimatum from the Russian side to us”.

After being informed that Ukraine had proposed an unconditional ceasefire of 30 to 60 days, Putin asked: “Why reward them by giving them a break from the combat, which will be used to **pump** the regime with western arms, to continue their forced mobilisation and to prepare different terrorist acts?”

On Sunday, Ukraine also carried out a remote-controlled mass drone attack on four Russian airfields, which Kyiv claims **knocked out** more than a third of Moscow’s heavy bombers capable of firing cruise missiles.

Satellite photos analysed and published by the Associated Press showed aircraft wreckage and **scorched** areas at Belaya base, one of the four airfields targeted.

It said the images showed at least three Tu-95 and four Tu-22M bombers – both capable of firing cruise missiles – had been destroyed on the runway. Other aircraft at the base appeared **unscathed**.

“We discussed the attack on Russia’s **docked** airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides,” Trump said.

During his election campaign, Trump claimed more than 50 times he could end the Ukraine conflict within a day, but his comments on Wednesday did not involve any calls for **restraint**.

Russia has claimed Ukrainian children were taken to Russia for their safety, while Kyiv insisted they had been abducted. The Ukrainian view was **underpinned** by the ICC, which issued arrest warrants in March 2023 for Putin and his “**commissioner** for children’s rights”, Maria Lvova-Belova, for their role in the “unlawful **deportation**” of the Ukrainian children.

“We are ready for such a meeting any day,” the Ukrainian leader said on Wednesday, adding it was “pointless” to hold further talks with the midlevel Russian delegates Putin has sent to the talks – who Zelenskyy has previously dismissed as “empty heads” – since they were not **empowered** to agree a ceasefire.

Since Trump’s return to the White House in January, European capitals have sought to take more of a leading role in bolstering Ukraine’s defence, and on Wednesday, a series of military industrial support measures were announced at a meeting of the 52-country strong Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Nato headquarters in Brussels, **chaired** jointly by the UK and Germany.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has voiced his **frustration** with Donald Trump by calling for “concrete actions” rather than “silence” after Russia launched one of its largest attacks on Kyiv of the war, with seven of the Ukrainian capital’s 10 districts hit overnight.

The **unrelenting** night-time raid stretched over five hours and will be seen as part of a continuing response by the Kremlin to Ukraine’s Operation Spiderweb, which struck Russia’s nuclear-capable bombers on Monday last week.

In a statement on his Telegram channel, Zelenskyy appeared to criticise the lack of response from the US and others to the recent stepping up of Russia’s attacks. Trump has **prevaricated** over the question of further economic sanctions on the Kremlin.

He added: “Ordinary houses and urban infrastructure were damaged, and even a **maternity** hospital in Odesa became a Russian target. Thirteen people were injured. Unfortunately, there are **fatalities**. My condolences to the relatives.

The **buzzing** of drones followed by explosions could be heard throughout the night in Kyiv, where residents had been told by the local authorities to take shelter in **bunkers**.

Timur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military district, said on Telegram: “A difficult night for all of us. Throughout the night, the enemy relentlessly **terrorised** Kyiv with attack drones. They targeted civilian infrastructure and peaceful residents of the city.”

“Tomorrow, we will begin urgent ‘**sanitary** exchanges’ of severely wounded prisoners,” Russia’s top negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, posted.

On Wednesday, a Ukrainian government agency announced that “the bodies of 1,212 fallen **defenders** were returned to Ukraine”.

Ukraine said its experts “will identify the **deceased** as soon as possible”.

It **characterised** the plant as one of the main facilities in Russia’s military industrial complex, making gunpowder for small arms, artillery and rocket systems.

The Ukrainian military also said it recorded explosions at an **ammunition** **depot** in Russia’s Kursk region and an airfield depot in Russia’s Voronezh region.

Vucic told Serbian media on Wednesday that the signing of the “anti-Russian” declaration wasn’t “easy and simple for us”, noting its mention of sanctions as one reason for **abstaining**. “But I would like to once again express my full gratitude to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the **exceptional** **hospitality** here in Odessa,” Vucic said.

Aircraft **leasing** companies have won a $4.7bn (£3.4bn) lawsuit against **insurers** over their planes **stranded** in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Restoration work started on Wednesday on Kyiv’s Unesco-listed 11th-century Saint Sophia **Cathedral** – one of the main symbols of Ukraine – after it was damaged by Russian strikes a day earlier. Zelenskyy said part of the cathedral’s **facade** collapsed.

Russia sent Tu-22M3 long-range bombers on a flight over the Baltic Sea on Wednesday, the defence ministry said, in the first such mission since Ukraine’s **stunning** 1 June attack where bombers were destroyed or badly damaged by drones at air bases in Siberia and the far north.

Donald Trump has displayed his **disdain** for the collective western values **supposedly** **championed** by the G7 group of industrialised countries by again demanding that Russia be **readmitted** to the group. He also said the war in Ukraine would not have happened if Moscow had been kept in the club.

Russia was thrown out of the G8 after it invaded Crimea in 2014, and Trump’s defence of Vladimir Putin came a day before the US president is scheduled to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the **fringes** of the summit. It will be the first meeting between the two men since Pope’s Francis’s funeral in April.

He blamed the former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama for Putin’s **expulsion**.

The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, signalled that the EU would be asking the US and other G7 member states to tighten sanctions on Russia by lowering the **cap** at which Russian oil can be bought from $60 a barrel to $45.

Ahead of his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy said: “Russia **spits** in the face of everything the international community is trying to do to stop this war.”

Trump has imposed levies on steel, **aluminium**, cars and other Canadian products that do not comply with the **continental** free trade agreement’s rules of origin.

#### [2025-06-20 Ukraine war briefing: Russia ‘on verge of recession’, Putin minister tells economic showcase](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-on-verge-of-recession-putin-minister-tells-economic-showcase)

Vladimir Putin’s economy minister has warned that Russia is “on the **verge**” of **recession** as he spoke on the second day of a signature event meant to bolster economic confidence.

Russia’s central bank raised interest rates to an **eye-watering** 21% in October 2024 to combat inflation and kept them at that level until this month when it eased them to 20%. Economists have warned since the war began that any Russian growth driven by the defence industry is unsustainable and does not reflect a real increase in **productivity**.

The plant, illegally held by the Russians, has too many issues with cooling water and its need for electricity supplied from **offsite**, the IAEA said.

Its deployment of Iranian-designed Shahed drones and North Korean munitions was proof that Kyiv’s allies were applying **insufficient** pressure against the Kremlin. “When one of their **accomplices** loses their capability to export war, Russia is weakened and tries to **interfere**. This is so **cynical** and proves time and again that aggressive regimes cannot be allowed to unite and become partners.”

The Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said the conflict between Israel and Iran had exposed Russian hypocrisy, with Moscow condemning strikes against Tehran while “**ruthlessly**” attacking Ukraine.

Before joining the army in April 2024, Felipenko **starred** in several stage productions and TV shows, playing a lead role in Ukrainian crime serial The Colour of Passion.

Fighting between Iran and Israel could **deflect** global attention from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and even bolster the Kremlin’s war effort, a senior Ukrainian political source told AFP.
