#### [2025-03-18 Vladimir Putin agrees to 30-day halt to attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/trump-and-putin-to-hold-high-stakes-call-on-ukraine)

Vladimir Putin has agreed to a limited ceasefire that would stop Russia targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure after a **high-stakes** phone call with Donald Trump.

But the Russian leader declined to commit to a 30-day full ceasefire, a plan pitched by Trump that Ukraine agreed to last week, **denting** the US president’s hope of bringing a quick end to hostilities.

Trump put a positive **spin** on the discussion, writing on his Truth Social platform shortly after the call ended that he had had a “very good and productive” conversation with Putin.

In his first public appearance since the call, Trump told Fox News interviewer Laura Ingraham: “And we want to **get it over with**.”

The “series of significant issues” included how such a ceasefire would be **enforced** and whether it would give Ukraine an opportunity to strengthen its forces and receive western military aid, it said.

It marked a low point in US-Ukrainian relations and **spooked** other allies that Washington may be about to abandon Kyiv.

We are very much on track,” he wrote, in language that was noticeably less **hyperbolic** than some of his pronouncements on the conflict.

Ukrainian officials say that they believe their relations with the Trump administration are now on **sounder footing**.

However, Peskov directly contradicted Trump, when speaking to reporters in Moscow: “The need to halt arms supplies to Kyiv was discussed during Putin and Trump’s conversation,” he said.

#### [2025-03-20 EU ready to impose more sanctions on Russia after summit talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/20/eu-ready-to-impose-more-sanctions-on-russia-after-summit-talks)

The show of unity was **marred** by Orbán refusing to support an EU text declaring support for Ukraine, which stated: “The European Council calls on Russia to show real political will to end the war.”

Orbán’s growing confidence in diverging from the EU on Ukraine raises questions about the bloc’s ability to impose new sanctions and renew existing ones, although diplomats **take comfort from** the fact Hungary has always **acceded** to the plans in the end.

Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy head, who led the initiative, is now calling on member states to provide 2m shells worth €5bn, a downgrade on her original plan that **envisaged** every country contributing military aid based on the size of its economy.

Spain and Italy, which both spend below the 2% Nato target on defence, say Europe cannot **overlook** other threats to security. Spain is urging a wider definition of defence spending to **encompass** cybersecurity, anti-terrorism and efforts to combat the climate crisis.

It was important, he said, “to take into account that the challenges that we face in the southern neighbourhood are a bit different to the ones the eastern **flank** face”.

#### [2025-03-23 Gulf in US and Russian expectations marks start of latest ceasefire talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/23/gulf-in-us-and-russian-expectations-marks-start-of-latest-ceasefire-talks)

This week’s talks are expected to **delve** into the details of implementing the 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure, and potentially expand into shipping in the Black Sea.

“And from that you’ll naturally **gravitate** to a full-on shooting ceasefire.”

Moscow **pulled out of** the deal in 2023, amid accusations that the west had failed to uphold its commitments to ease sanctions on Russia’s exports of farm produce and fertilisers.

Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Witkoff, a real **estate** developer who had no prior diplomatic experience before being tasked as Donald Trump’s special envoy, downplayed fears of Vladimir Putin launching a broader aggression.

The agenda is, stop the killing, stop the **carnage**. Let’s end this thing.

He dismissed Keir Starmer’s readiness to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine post-ceasefire as “a combination of a **posture** and a pose”.

I think that’s **preposterous**.

When asked about the upcoming talks, however, Witkoff said the “central issue” was the Ukrainian regions that had been annexed or partially occupied by Russian forces. He **stumbled**, however, in trying to name them.

Earlier this month, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine would not recognise any occupied territories – where Russia was accused of holding **sham** polls in 2022 in a bid to provide cover for their illegal annexation – as Russian.

Witkoff appeared to side with the Kremlin as he cited the largely discredited polls as evidence of local sentiment on the ground and **conflated** the locally spoken language with support for Russia.

He went to his local church and met with his **priest** and prayed for the president.

#### [2025-03-24 Ukraine accuses Moscow of ‘hollow statements about peace’ after latest attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/24/ukraine-accuses-moscow-of-hollow-statements-about-peace-after-latest-attack)

================================================================================================================================================

Ukraine has accused Moscow of making “**hollow** statements about peace” after 88 people were injured in a Russian missile attack.

Russian media reported that a draft joint statement had been sent to Moscow and Washington for approval, with the parties **aiming to** release it on Tuesday.

But uncertainty remains over how and when the partial ceasefire would take effect – and whether its scope would extend beyond energy infrastructure to include other critical sites, such as hospitals, bridges and **vital** **utilities**.

US officials held initial talks with Ukraine on Sunday evening and negotiated separately with Russia on Monday, with most meetings taking place at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in **Riyadh**.

The US is expected to **shuttle** between the two countries to **finalise** details and negotiate separate measures to ensure the safety of shipping in the Black Sea.

As the Russia-US talks began in Riyadh, Trump said he expected Washington and Kyiv to sign a **revenue-sharing** agreement on Ukrainian critical minerals soon.

Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump listed issues he said were on the table: “We’re talking about territory right now. We’re talking about lines of **demarcation**, talking about power, power-plant ownership.”

The **lead-up** to the talks was marked by a series of pro-Russian statements by Witkoff – **tapped** by Trump as his personal envoy to Putin – in which he appeared to **legitimise** Russia’s staged referendums in four Ukrainian regions.

The referendums in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces were widely rebuked in the west as illegitimate and are viewed as a **thinly** **veiled** attempt to justify Russia’s illegal annexation of the regions. Their annexation marked the largest **forcible** **seizure** of territory in Europe since the second world war.

In the interview with Carlson, Witkoff also claimed Putin had **commissioned** a portrait of Trump “by a **leading** Russian painter” that the envoy had brought back with him after a trip to Moscow.

“I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war and all the **ingredients** that **led up to** it,” he added.

In an interview with Time magazine published on Monday but **conducted** before Witkoff’s remarks, Zelenskyy said some US officials had begun to take Putin at his word even when it contradicted their own intelligence.

Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on what would be acceptable terms for a peace treaty, with no sign that Putin has **relinquished** any of his maximalist aims in the war against Ukraine.

Ukraine remains deeply sceptical of any Russian agreement, pointing to past **instances** where Moscow failed to **honour** its commitments.

#### [2025-03-26 Russian strikes show Moscow does not want ‘real peace’, says Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/26/russian-ukraine-drone-strikes-zelenskyy-peace)

Ukraine’s president has accused Russia of being **insincere** about making peace as he reported an attack by 117 drones.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that launching **nationwide** strikes after negotiations over maritime and energy ceasefires was proof of Russia’s true intention.

The country’s air force said it shot down 56 of the 117 incoming drones and another 48 were **decoys** that caused no damage.

“Last night, there were another 117 proofs in our skies of how Russia continues to **drag out** this war,” Zelenskyy posted on X.

Parallel talks between Russia and the US and the US and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia this week had reached agreement on implementing a ceasefire in the Black Sea and a 30-day halt to strikes on energy targets already agreed to **in principle** by the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.

“We are satisfied with how pragmatically and constructively our dialogue is developing and by how it is **yielding** results,” he said.

A list of Russian and Ukrainian targets to be covered by the energy **moratorium** had been agreed with the help of US negotiators.

Ukraine’s leader said the energy ceasefire should be ready to **come into force** from today.

Together they are trying to **stitch** together a “**reassurance** force” to provide security to Ukraine in the event of a negotiated **armistice** or peace.

Details about who will participate and the size of the force have been **sparse** with speculation that it could contain 10,000 to 30,000 troops plus fighter jet **policing** to secure Ukraine’s air space, as well as maritime patrols **de-mining** the Black Sea to protect grain exports.

Ihor Zhovkva said the reassurance force had to be strong enough to **fend** off any Russian aggression, if necessary.

Donald Trump has been pressing for a full end to the fighting in Ukraine, declaring on the campaign trail before his election that he could end the war in 24 hours, though earlier this month he described his own statement as “a little bit **sarcastic**”.

“I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they’re **dragging their feet**,” Trump said in a TV interview.

Ukraine’s strategy is to engage constructively in the talks, showing it is ready to agree to intermediate ceasefire proposals, and switch the **onus** on peace to Russia in the belief the Kremlin will raise more pre-conditions.
