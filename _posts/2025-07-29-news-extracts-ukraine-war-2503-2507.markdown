#### [2025-03-18 Vladimir Putin agrees to 30-day halt to attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/trump-and-putin-to-hold-high-stakes-call-on-ukraine)

Vladimir Putin has agreed to a limited ceasefire that would stop Russia targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure after a **high-stakes** phone call with Donald Trump.

But the Russian leader declined to commit to a 30-day full ceasefire, a plan pitched by Trump that Ukraine agreed to last week, **denting** the US president’s hope of bringing a quick end to hostilities.

Trump put a positive **spin** on the discussion, writing on his Truth Social platform shortly after the call ended that he had had a “very good and productive” conversation with Putin.

In his first public appearance since the call, Trump told Fox News interviewer Laura Ingraham: “And we want to **get it over with**.”

The “series of significant issues” included how such a ceasefire would be **enforced** and whether it would give Ukraine an opportunity to strengthen its forces and receive western military aid, it said.

#### [2025-03-19 Trump and Zelenskyy share ‘frank’ but ‘very good’ call as Ukraine accepts partial ceasefire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/19/trump-has-very-good-phone-call-with-zelenskyy-who-signs-on-to-partial-ceasefire)

It marked a low point in US-Ukrainian relations and **spooked** other allies that Washington may be about to abandon Kyiv.

We are very much on track,” he wrote, in language that was noticeably less **hyperbolic** than some of his pronouncements on the conflict.

Ukrainian officials say that they believe their relations with the Trump administration are now on **sounder footing**.

However, Peskov directly contradicted Trump, when speaking to reporters in Moscow: “The need to halt arms supplies to Kyiv was discussed during Putin and Trump’s conversation,” he said.

#### [2025-03-20 EU ready to impose more sanctions on Russia after summit talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/20/eu-ready-to-impose-more-sanctions-on-russia-after-summit-talks)

The show of unity was **marred** by Orbán refusing to support an EU text declaring support for Ukraine, which stated: “The European Council calls on Russia to show real political will to end the war.”

Orbán’s growing confidence in diverging from the EU on Ukraine raises questions about the bloc’s ability to impose new sanctions and renew existing ones, although diplomats **take comfort from** the fact Hungary has always **acceded** to the plans in the end.

Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy head, who led the initiative, is now calling on member states to provide 2m shells worth €5bn, a downgrade on her original plan that **envisaged** every country contributing military aid based on the size of its economy.

Spain and Italy, which both spend below the 2% Nato target on defence, say Europe cannot **overlook** other threats to security. Spain is urging a wider definition of defence spending to **encompass** cybersecurity, anti-terrorism and efforts to combat the climate crisis.

It was important, he said, “to take into account that the challenges that we face in the southern neighbourhood are a bit different to the ones the eastern **flank** face”.

#### [2025-03-23 Gulf in US and Russian expectations marks start of latest ceasefire talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/23/gulf-in-us-and-russian-expectations-marks-start-of-latest-ceasefire-talks)

This week’s talks are expected to **delve** into the details of implementing the 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure, and potentially expand into shipping in the Black Sea.

“And from that you’ll naturally **gravitate** to a full-on shooting ceasefire.”

Moscow **pulled out of** the deal in 2023, amid accusations that the west had failed to uphold its commitments to ease sanctions on Russia’s exports of farm produce and fertilisers.

Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Witkoff, a real **estate** developer who had no prior diplomatic experience before being tasked as Donald Trump’s special envoy, downplayed fears of Vladimir Putin launching a broader aggression.

The agenda is, stop the killing, stop the **carnage**. Let’s end this thing.

He dismissed Keir Starmer’s readiness to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine post-ceasefire as “a combination of a **posture** and a pose”.

I think that’s **preposterous**.

When asked about the upcoming talks, however, Witkoff said the “central issue” was the Ukrainian regions that had been annexed or partially occupied by Russian forces. He **stumbled**, however, in trying to name them.

Earlier this month, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine would not recognise any occupied territories – where Russia was accused of holding **sham** polls in 2022 in a bid to provide cover for their illegal annexation – as Russian.

Witkoff appeared to side with the Kremlin as he cited the largely discredited polls as evidence of local sentiment on the ground and **conflated** the locally spoken language with support for Russia.

He went to his local church and met with his **priest** and prayed for the president.

#### [2025-03-24 Ukraine accuses Moscow of ‘hollow statements about peace’ after latest attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/24/ukraine-accuses-moscow-of-hollow-statements-about-peace-after-latest-attack)

The US is expected to **shuttle** between the two countries to finalise details and negotiate separate measures to ensure the safety of shipping in the Black Sea.

Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump listed issues he said were on the table: “We’re talking about territory right now. We’re talking about lines of **demarcation**, talking about power, power-plant ownership.”

The **lead-up** to the talks was marked by a series of pro-Russian statements by Witkoff – **tapped** by Trump as his personal envoy to Putin – in which he appeared to legitimise Russia’s staged referendums in four Ukrainian regions.

The referendums in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces were widely rebuked in the west as illegitimate and are viewed as a thinly **veiled** attempt to justify Russia’s illegal annexation of the regions.

“I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war and all the **ingredients** that led up to it,” he added.

#### [2025-03-26 Russian strikes show Moscow does not want ‘real peace’, says Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/26/russian-ukraine-drone-strikes-zelenskyy-peace)

“We are satisfied with how pragmatically and constructively our dialogue is developing and by how it is **yielding** results,” he said.

A list of Russian and Ukrainian targets to be covered by the energy **moratorium** had been agreed with the help of US negotiators.

Together they are trying to **stitch** together a “reassurance force” to provide security to Ukraine in the event of a negotiated **armistice** or peace.

Details about who will participate and the size of the force have been **sparse** with speculation that it could contain 10,000 to 30,000 troops plus fighter jet **policing** to secure Ukraine’s air space, as well as maritime patrols de-mining the Black Sea to protect grain exports.

Donald Trump has been pressing for a full end to the fighting in Ukraine, declaring on the campaign trail before his election that he could end the war in 24 hours, though earlier this month he described his own statement as “a little bit **sarcastic**”.

Ukraine’s strategy is to engage constructively in the talks, showing it is ready to agree to intermediate ceasefire proposals, and switch the **onus** on peace to Russia in the belief the Kremlin will raise more pre-conditions.

#### [2025-04-28 Putin and Kim confirm for first time North Koreans fought for Russia in Ukraine war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/28/north-korea-troops-fighting-for-russia-ukraine-confirmed-kim-jong-un)

Kim, whose material support for Putin could earn North Korea access to Russian satellite and military technology to boost its nuclear missile programme, said a **monument** would soon be built in the capital, Pyongyang, to honour his soldiers’ “battle **feats**”.

“The two countries agreed to disclose the deployment because they judged that the benefits of compensation for the troop deployment **outweighed** the potential damage to their international image,” Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told Agence France-Presse.

“North Korea likely aimed to **showcase** that victory was achieved thanks to their involvement, thereby securing greater rewards from Russia,” he added.

#### [2025-05-07 Xi Jinping to begin four-day Russia visit after Ukrainian drones attack Moscow](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/07/xi-jinping-begins-russia-visit-china-ukrainian-drones-moscow)

Xi Jinping is flying to Moscow for the start2 of a four-day visit during which he will attend Russia’s military **parade** **commemorating** the anniversary of the end of the second world war, known in Russia as Victory Day.

Aleksandar Vučić’s visit to Moscow, for which he has been heavily criticised by several major European capitals, had already faced complications after Latvia and Lithuania reportedly barred his plane from their airspace, forcing a significant **detour**.

In an article published on Wednesday, Xi wrote: “China and Russia are both major countries with significant influence and are constructive forces in maintaining global strategic stability and improving global governance … Together we must **foil** all schemes to disrupt or undermine our **bonds** of **amity** and trust”.

But in recent months Kyiv has been increasingly **outspoken** about what it says is China’s direct aid for Moscow’s war efforts.

#### [2025-05-08 Xi hails ‘confident’ China-Russia ties as Putin welcomes ‘dear friend’ to Kremlin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-china-russia-kremlin)

Xi said the Sino-Russian relationship was “confident, stable and **resilient**” in the new era and that China was willing to work with Russia to promote a multipolar world.

Xi, whose plane was escorted by Russian fighter jets, was greeted on Wednesday by a military band playing the national **anthems** of Russia and China.

On Thursday he said the world was facing “unilateralism and acts of hegemonic bullying in the international **arena**”, a veiled reference to the US-China trade war, in which China has accused the US of coercive behaviour.

Lai compared Taiwan’s current **predicament** to that of European countries before the start of the second world war.

#### [2025-05-09 China and Russia pledge to deepen ties as they criticise US on Victory Day](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/09/china-russia-ties-criticise-us-victory-day)

In a lengthy statement published during Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow for the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which Russia celebrates on 9 May as Victory Day, Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin said “certain countries … are attempting to **tamper** with the results of the victory of the second world war”.

“The United States and its allies are trying to promote Nato’s eastward expansion into the Asia-Pacific region, build ‘small circles’ in the Asia-Pacific region, and **win over** countries in the region to promote their ‘Indo-Pacific strategy’, undermining regional peace, stability and prosperity,” the statement read.

The statement also said that “unilateral coercive measures, including economic sanctions, that **bypass** the UN security council violate the UN Charter and other international laws and undermine international security interests”.

This week’s meeting of the Chinese and Russian leaders underscores the close relationship between the two men who see themselves as a **bulwark** against US hegemony.

#### [2025-05-09 Chinese troops march with Russian forces as Xi joins Putin for Victory Day parade](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade)

Russian troops fighting in Ukraine have marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater **spectacle** than in recent years.

After several **scaled-back** Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests – Vladimir Putin on Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

“The Soviet Union **took upon** itself the most ferocious, merciless blows of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine.

While Putin was **presiding** over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a **tribunal** for Russian war crimes.

The Kremlin presented the **turnout** as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine.

Other guests included leaders from fellow **autocracies** and pariah regimes, such as the military **juntas** from Myanmar and Burkina Faso.

For the first time, several types of modern Russian-made drones were also on display, underscoring their role as a **defining** feature of the conflict.

The showcase of weaponry marked a stark contrast to 2024’s **toned-down** parade, when a single Soviet-era tank rolled through Red Square.

Over his two-and-a-half decades in power, Victory Day has emerged as the **centrepiece** of Putin’s vision of Russian identity.

Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to mobilise support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader **resurrecting** nazism in Ukraine.

In a speech a day earlier, Zelenskyy condemned what he called Russia’s attempt to “**appropriate** Ukraine and distort history”, accusing the Kremlin of twisting the legacy of the second world war for propaganda purposes.

“Tomorrow, the organiser of the **mass graves** in Bucha will speak of Nazi atrocities. The architects of the Mariupol siege will invoke the siege of **Leningrad**. It will be a parade of **cynicism**, **bile**, and lies,” Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as **self-serving** and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected.

#### [2025-05-13 Trump must realise Putin is obstacle to peace, Zelenskyy says](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/13/volodymyr-zelenskyy-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-peace-talks-turkey)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he hopes the current period of **frantic** diplomacy and high-stakes **gambits** between Russia and Ukraine will end with Donald Trump understanding that Vladimir Putin is the real obstacle to a peace deal.

“Trump needs to believe that Putin actually lies. And we should do our part. **Sensibly** approach this issue, to show that it’s not us that is slowing down the process,” said Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy said he had arranged to meet with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Ankara, but would be ready to fly to Istanbul **at a moment’s notice** if the Russian leader showed up.

“Without signals from the leaders, or a meeting of the leaders, this **format** doesn’t work,” he said.

The **back-and-forth** diplomacy began with a visit to Kyiv by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland on Saturday, timed symbolically to come just one day after a **set-piece** military parade in Moscow marking 80 years since the Soviet victory in the second world war.

After the disastrous White House meeting at the end of February, Zelenskyy appears to have had some success turning the relationship around, **culminating** in a positive meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral in the Vatican last month.

British and French officials have been speaking regularly with Ukrainian counterparts since the White House **debacle** and offering guidance on how to mend relations with the US administration.

“He has a very creative approach … He’s a **risk-taker**.

After his visit to Turkey, Zelenskyy is expected to visit Albania for a meeting of European politicians on Friday, and then may travel to Rome, where he suggested he could attend the **inaugural** mass of the new pope, Leo XIV, after having a positive phone call with him earlier this week.

#### [2025-05-15 Zelenskyy sends team for peace talks but says Russia ‘not serious enough’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/15/zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-istanbul)

Throughout the conference in Ankara, Zelenskyy sought to frame Russia’s choice of delegation as a sign to Trump that Moscow was not approaching the talks **in good faith**.

Medinsky also echoed a **well-worn** Kremlin talking point, saying Russia aimed to address the “root causes” of the war – a phrase frequently used by Putin to justify the invasion.

Boris Bondarev, a former senior Russian diplomat who resigned after Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine, said: “Putin clearly doesn’t want any genuine peace talks, nor any ceasefire, unless it’s entirely **on his terms**.”

#### [2025-05-19 Trump and Putin hold phone call but Kremlin refuses Ukraine ceasefire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/19/trump-and-putin-hold-phone-call-but-kremlin-refuses-ukraine-ceasefire)

Crucially, Putin repeated his longstanding **refrain** that the “root causes” of the war must be addressed: a reference to Russia’s far-reaching demands that would severely undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty.

In an apparent show of confidence and **nonchalance**, Putin took the call with Trump on Monday while touring a music school in Sochi. His **bravado** is fuelled by Russia’s slow but steady battlefield gains, Europe’s **disjointed** response, and a domestic economy increasingly adapted for a prolonged war.

#### [2025-05-23 Satellite images reveal damage to North Korea warship after ‘criminal’ launch accident](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/23/north-korea-ship-satellite-images-launch-accident-damage-failure-warship-destroyer)

Satellite images have revealed the extent of a navy shipyard accident in North Korea that resulted in serious damage to a warship and **infuriated** the country’s leader Kim Jong-un.

Images taken by satellite show the warship lying on its side, with the bow of the vessel on land, while a large portion of the **stern** lies in the water. The **stricken** ship has been covered by large blue **tarpaulins**.

An internal inspection found that there were no holes in the warship’s bottom, but the **starboard** **hull** was **scratched** and seawater flowed into the stern section through the rescue channel, the report said.

The **mishap** likely occurred in front of a large crowd, increasing the public humiliation for Kim, military analysts said.

The shipyard in Chongjin has primarily produced **cargo** vessels and fishing vessels and “undoubtedly lacks significant **expertise**” in launching large warships such as the new destroyer, CSIS added.

#### [2025-05-24 North Korea detains three over warship launch accident, state media reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/24/north-korea-detains-three-over-warship-launch-accident-state-media-reports)

South Korea’s military said US and Seoul intelligence authorities assessed that North Korea’s “side-launch attempt” of the ship failed, and the vessel was left **listing** in the water.

Satellite imagery shows the warship, covered in blue tarpaulins, lying on its side, with the stern **swung out** into the harbour, but the bow remaining on the side slipway, according to the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

#### [2025-05-28 Zelenskyy warns of Russian troops gathering in Sumy as he visits Merz in Berlin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/28/zelenskyy-merz-germany-ukraine-sumy)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Russia has **amassed** 50,000 of its troops in the Sumy region before a planned large-scale offensive.

Germany’s freshly appointed chancellor received Zelenskyy in Berlin amid expectations he would announce new plans to aid Ukraine. Merz welcomed Zelenskyy with military honours at the **chancellery** building in the German capital.

Berlin is one of Kyiv’s main backers, a **course** that Merz, who came into office last month, has promised to continue.

This would enable Kyiv to defend itself more effectively without Berlin having to be concerned about being labelled a “war **monger**”.

Speaking at a security conference in Moscow, Lavrov said the announcement was **reminiscent** of “the periods of the previous century when Germany twice became the leading military power and how much trouble this brought”.

#### [2025-06-01 Ukraine launches major drone attack on Russian bombers, security official says](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/01/ukraine-launches-major-drone-attack-on-russian-bombers-security-official-says)

Ukraine smuggled the drones to the **perimeter** of the airfields hidden in the roofs of wooden sheds.

The drones were first smuggled into Russia and later **concealed** under the roofs of small wooden sheds which were loaded on to trucks and driven to the perimeter of the airbases.

But it has developed a **nimble** and **sizeable** fleet of attack drones used to strike Russia’s army and energy infrastructure.

#### [2025-06-04 Putin tells Trump Russia ‘will have to respond’ to Ukraine drone attack](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/trump-putin-conversation-ukraine-drone-attack)

He noted instead that Putin had **offered to** participate in US talks with Iran about its nuclear programme, which Trump claimed Tehran had been “slowwalking”.

The comments from both leaders confirmed negotiations in Istanbul on Monday had made no **headway** towards a truce, but the two sides signalled progress on other issues, including the transfer of captives and bodies.

On Sunday, Ukraine also carried out a remote-controlled mass drone attack on four Russian airfields, which Kyiv claims **knocked out** more than a third of Moscow’s heavy bombers capable of firing cruise missiles.

Other aircraft at the base appeared **unscathed**.

The Ukrainian view was **underpinned** by the ICC, which issued arrest warrants in March 2023 for Putin and his “commissioner for children’s rights”, Maria Lvova-Belova, for their role in the “unlawful deportation” of the Ukrainian children.

#### [2025-06-10 Zelenskyy calls for ‘concrete actions’ as Russian strikes hit seven of Kyiv’s 10 districts](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/zelenskyy-russian-strikes-kyiv-ukraine-moscow)

The **unrelenting** night-time raid stretched over five hours and will be seen as part of a continuing response by the Kremlin to Ukraine’s Operation Spiderweb, which struck Russia’s nuclear-capable bombers on Monday last week.

Trump has **prevaricated** over the question of further economic sanctions on the Kremlin.

He added: “Ordinary houses and urban infrastructure were damaged, and even a **maternity** hospital in Odesa became a Russian target.”

#### [2025-06-12 Ukraine war briefing: severely wounded soldiers next in prisoner exchanges](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/12/ukraine-war-briefing-severely-wounded-soldiers-next-in-prisoner-exchanges)

“Tomorrow, we will begin urgent ‘**sanitary** exchanges’ of severely wounded prisoners,” Russia’s top negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, posted.

Ukraine said its experts “will identify the **deceased** as soon as possible”.

Vucic told Serbian media on Wednesday that the signing of the “anti-Russian” declaration wasn’t “easy and simple for us”, noting its mention of sanctions as one reason for **abstaining**.

Aircraft **leasing** companies have won a $4.7bn (£3.4bn) lawsuit against **insurers** over their planes **stranded** in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Donald Trump has displayed his **disdain** for the collective western values **supposedly** championed by the G7 group of industrialised countries by again demanding that Russia be **readmitted** to the group.

He blamed the former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama for Putin’s **expulsion**.

Ahead of his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy said: “Russia **spits** in the face of everything the international community is trying to do to stop this war.”

#### [2025-06-20 Ukraine war briefing: Russia ‘on verge of recession’, Putin minister tells economic showcase](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-on-verge-of-recession-putin-minister-tells-economic-showcase)

Vladimir Putin’s economy minister has warned that Russia is “on the **verge**” of recession as he spoke on the second day of a signature event meant to bolster economic confidence.

Russia’s central bank raised interest rates to an **eye-watering** 21% in October 2024 to combat inflation and kept them at that level until this month when it eased them to 20%.

“When one of their **accomplices** loses their capability to export war, Russia is weakened and tries to interfere. This is so **cynical** and proves time and again that aggressive regimes cannot be allowed to unite and become partners.”

The Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said the conflict between Israel and Iran had exposed Russian hypocrisy, with Moscow condemning strikes against Tehran while “**ruthlessly**” attacking Ukraine.

Before joining the army in April 2024, Felipenko **starred** in several stage productions and TV shows, playing a lead role in Ukrainian crime serial The Colour of Passion.

One image **purportedly** showed pages from a blood-stained notebook, believed to have belonged to a North Korean soldier, that had been retrieved from a battlefield in Russia’s Kursk region.

“Let us bravely fight this sacred battle with the boundless love and trust **bestowed** upon us by our beloved Supreme Commander” – a reference to Kim.

In remarks to Russia’s state TV Channel One that aired Monday evening, Pasechnik said he had received a report “**literally** two days ago” saying that “100%” of the region was now under the control of Russian forces.

Brussels and Kyiv have been **wrangling** over the deal after protests from farmers saw the EU slap **quotas** on tariff-free Ukrainian agricultural imports into the bloc. Brussels added certain restrictions in 2024, when it extended the agreement for one additional year, by introducing a maximum ceiling on certain tariff-free products such as **cereals**, **poultry**, eggs, sugar and corn.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “wants to **subjugate** the whole of Ukraine and at the same time spread fear throughout Europe,” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on a visit to Kyiv on Monday.

#### [2025-07-02 US halts weapons shipments to Ukraine over fears stockpiles are too low](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/02/us-halts-ukraine-weapons-shipments)

The US **stoppage** was first reported by Politico.

In testimony before lawmakers in June, defence secretary Pete Hegseth said he had moved quickly to **quash** wasteful programmes and redirect funding to Trump’s top objectives.

The defense secretary told lawmakers last month that some US security spending for Ukraine was still in the **pipeline**, without providing details. But he said such assistance – which has been robust for the past two years – would be reduced.

The Joint Stock Company Federal Scientific and Production Centre Scientific Research Institute of Applied Chemistry was sanctioned for supplying the Russian military with RG-Vo riot control grenades whose use in warfare **contravenes** the international chemical weapons convention.

Apartment buildings, a kindergarten and the regional **draft** office were damaged in two waves of strikes, local and military officials said.

Ukraine’s military said it struck a chemical plant in Russia’s Moscow region that manufactures explosives, ammunition and **thermobaric** warheads for Shahed attack drones.

Khalil Arslanov, a **colonel** general, and others were found guilty of stealing 1.6bn roubles (£14.9m/US$20.3m) from state contracts with Voentelecom, which provides telecommunications services and equipment to the Russian military.

Donald Trump was reportedly caught **off guard** by the Pentagon’s **abrupt** move to pause Ukraine weapons deliveries, which the president has overturned. The Associated Press cited three people familiar with the matter, one of whom described Trump as being caught “**flat footed**” by last week’s announcement. But asked by a reporter on Tuesday who had approved the pause, Trump **bristled** at the question while he was gathered with his Cabinet. “I don’t know. Why don’t you tell me?”

On Wednesday, Russia **pummelled** Ukraine with its largest missile and drone attack in more than three years of war – a dark record that is seemingly reset higher every few days.

“If so it is a **transformatory** moment, and a **vindication** for both Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives in Rome for the annual Ukraine reconstruction conference and for those others, notably the British and the French governments, who have patiently helped the scales to fall from Trump’s eyes about Putin’s true intentions.

Europe’s top human rights court delivered **damning** judgments on Wednesday against Russia in four cases brought by Kyiv and the Netherlands. Russia violated the convention through “**extrajudicial** killing of civilians and Ukrainian military personnel” outside of combat, “torture”, “forced labour”, “unlawful and arbitrary detention of civilians” as well as looting in its invasion of Ukraine, the judges found.

Falling drone debris also caused fires at **garages** and a gas station in another capital district, Darnytsky.

Trump, who returned to power this year promising a swift end to the war that began in 2022, had taken a more **conciliatory** tone towards Moscow in a departure from predecessor Joe Biden’s staunch support for Kyiv.

#### [2025-07-11 Ukraine war briefing: Trump poised to send weapons under Biden-style drawdown, say sources](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/11/ukraine-war-briefing-trump-poised-to-send-weapons-under-biden-style-drawdown-say-sources)

Donald Trump may be preparing to send weapons to Ukraine using presidential **drawdown** authority (PDA) – a **discretion** that his predecessor, Joe Biden, used to urgently arm Kyiv’s forces. Sources told Reuters that Trump’s team would identify arms from US stockpiles to send to Ukraine under the PDA, with one saying the **tranche** could be worth about $300m.

Much of what Biden sent using PDA was surplus equipment in US reserve stockpiles that was due for replacement or to be scrapped – a fact that **rebuts** the argument that arming Ukraine leaves the US short of weaponry for its own purposes.

The SBU, a **sprawling** domestic spy agency with thousands of staff, said it had opened a criminal investigation into the murder of one of its employees in Kyiv’s southern Holosiivskyi district.

Russian authorities have **confiscated** western assets worth about \$50bn over the past three years, research showed on Wednesday.

“This case may serve as a **precedent-setting** moment in South Korean **jurisprudence**, as domestic courts have had little prior case law dealing with crimes against humanity,” said Seongyeop Lee, a human rights analyst at NKDB.

The complaint draws heavily on the 2014 UN commission of **inquiry** that found North Korea committed widespread crimes against humanity, including torture, sexual violence and arbitrary detention.

Previous civil lawsuits against North Korea include cases by former prisoners of war seeking compensation for forced labour, families of South Koreans **abducted** during the Korean war, and a 2023 case seeking damages for North Korea’s destruction of an inter-Korean **liaison** office.

However, enforcement remains impossible as there is no mechanism to compel North Korea to pay damages even when **plaintiffs** win, making such victories largely symbolic.

Lavrov **lauded** Wonsan as “a good tourist attraction”, adding: “We hope it will be popular not only with local citizens, but also with Russians.”

Lavrov also warned the US, South Korea and Japan against forming a security partnership targeting North Korea, accusing the countries of what he called military **buildups** around North Korea. We respect North Korea’s **aspirations** and understand the reasons why it is pursuing nuclear development,” Lavrov said, according to Tass.

The Russian defence ministry said it had targeted companies in Ukraine’s military-industrial complex in Lviv, Kharkiv and Lutsk and a military **aerodrome**.

The US special envoy Keith Kellogg is due to begin his latest visit to Ukraine on Monday as a Washington-led peace effort **flounders**.

Some voices in Moscow, however, **lamented** that Trump’s once-positive relationship with Putin may have fundamentally shifted.

The journalist and blogger Illia Ponomarenko suggested Trump had allowed himself to be **deceived** in his dealings with Putin.

Rather, Trump had believed he could ‘“achieve peace’ by **indulging** and encouraging the aggressor’s appetite”, he said.

The president and his top officials have been **derisive** about Kyiv’s chances of **prevailing**.

On Monday, Trump delivered his most admiring language on Ukraine and its European backers to date, with Rutte on one side and the US vice-president, JD Vance, the administration’s biggest **sceptic** on US involvement in Europe, on the other.

“The level of **esprit** de corps spirit that they have is amazing,” he said. “They really think it’s very, very important.

Trump described his deepening **disillusion** with Putin, and suggested his wife, Melania, may have played a role in pointing out the Russian leader’s **duplicity** in talks over a peace deal.

Konstantin Kosachev, a senior Russian lawmaker, wrote on Telegram that it amounted to “**hot air**”.

Illia Ponomarenko, a Ukrainian journalist and blogger wrote: “How many Ukrainian lives could have been saved if, from the very beginning, Trump had listened to wise and honest people about helping Ukraine, instead of the **artful** lies of that **cannibal** Putin on the phone?”.

The Ukrainian wing of an internationally proscribed far-right terrorist organization with suspected links to Russia is claiming involvement in the **brazen** assassination of an intelligence officer in Kyiv.

The same post, translated from Ukrainian, added that the group’s members were “proud of our associates” who carried out the killing and said they didn’t care if **naysayers** thought of them as “terrorists and extremists”.

Sources in the counter-terrorism field reviewed the posts and said they appeared credible and represented an escalation from the Base, which is now either endorsing treasonous murders inside of Ukraine, actively **commissioning** them, or both.

On Sunday, the SBU announced it had killed the two suspects they say were instructed and supplied with a **pistol** to assassinate Voronych on behalf of “Russian special services” handlers.

In April, the Base started waging what it described as an **insurgency** to establish an all-white ethnostate in the western Ukrainian oblast of Zakarpattia.

Nazzaro, who lives the life of a semi-**defected** American in St Petersburg with his Russian wife and family, has for years denied any associations with Russian intelligence, going so far as to tell a Kremlin-controlled television channel that he had “never had any contact with any Russian security services”.

But the digital **forensics** of the group and Nazzaro’s public history say otherwise: the Base’s online footprints rely heavily on Russian digital infrastructure, with its recruitment email using a Mail.ru address – the email service owned by a Putin ally.

The EU was unable to approve a new package of sanctions against Russia on Tuesday as Slovakia demanded more guarantees that it would not be harmed by a separate EU plan to **phase out** Russian gas.

Donald Trump’s move to **take credit** for the additional weapons headed to Ukraine at Europe’s expense has created some mild friction in EU-US relations.

Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador to Nato, **predicted** Ukraine could ultimately receive 12 to 13 Patriot batteries but it could take a year for them all to be delivered.

Ukraine’s arms production ramp-up so far has **emphasised** drones and air defences.

Zelenskyy described the attack as “simply **horrific**, stupid Russian terror.

A week ago Trump, the US president, threatened Russia with “severe tariffs” unless a peace deal was reached within 50 days and announced a **rejuvenated** pipeline for US weapons to reach Ukraine amid his frustration at unsuccessful talks to end the war.

Two more civilians were injured in the north-eastern Kharkiv province after a drone **slammed** into a residential building, local Ukrainian officials said.

Trump, though, has also continually extended, reset or failed to honour deadlines – starting with his **unmet** promise to end the war in 24 hours – and placed low expectations on Russia’s behaviour.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy promised a new bill to strengthen the rule of law in Ukraine on Wednesday, in an apparent attempt to **assuage** popular anger at his decision to weaken the powers of two independent anti-corruption agencies.

But the apparent concession left protesters **unimpressed**. They said Zelenskyy has not agreed to scrap the controversial aspects of Tuesday’s bill and pointed out that the Verkhovna Rada – Ukraine’s parliament, which approved the changes – has gone on holiday for the summer **recess**.

Critics say they have been **stripped** of their autonomy, making them **indistinguishable** from ordinary law enforcement bodies.

Zelenskyy says the **shake-up** was needed to clean Ukraine’s “anti-corruption infrastructure” of alleged Russian connections.

“It’s in our DNA. We have a very good sense for where the red line is, and for when people cross this line. If anyone tries to tighten their grip on power people pour into the streets,” he said, citing the uprisings in 2004 and 2014 against perceived government **misrule**.
