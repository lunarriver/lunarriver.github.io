#### [2025-05-01 Snake on a train line: Japan’s busiest bullet train route brought to a halt](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/japan-snake-bullet-train)

Japan’s busiest bullet train line was brought to a halt on Wednesday after a metre-long snake wrapped itself around a power line, **shorting** the electricity supply and **stranding** hundreds of passengers.

**Shinkansen** trains running between Tokyo and **Osaka** were brought to a **standstill** by the snake, with news reports showing footage of people inside trains waiting for services to resume. Power did not appear to have been cut inside trains, with lights and air conditioning still functioning, according to passengers.

The **outage** happened at 5.25pm between Maibara and Gifu-Hashima stations, after the snake appeared to have climbed an electricity **pole**, meeting its **demise** as it attempted to **slither** along the overhead line. Power was not restored until after 7pm.

The Golden Week series of national holidays began on Wednesday, with millions on the move across Japan, returning to home towns and taking family vacations. In addition, the Osaka Expo 2025, which opened mid-April and runs until October, is attracting even more people than usual to the city.

“I use the shinkansen several times a month, but this is the first time I have experienced suspensions due to a power outage,” Satoshi Tagawa, 46, who was returning to Tokyo, told Kyodo News.

The line connects Tokyo, **Nagoya** and Osaka with more than 370 trains daily carrying an average of 430,000 passengers. Reaching speeds of up 285km per hour, it takes less than two and a half hours to Osaka from the Japanese capital.

More than 7 billion passengers have ridden the tokaido shinkansen since it opened as Japan’s first high-speed rail line just before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. It has an **exemplary** safety record, with not a single injury or accident recorded, and trains running to within an average of 1.6 minutes of their scheduled times, according to operator Central Japan Railway Co. (JR Tokai).

However, it is not the first time reptiles have delayed shinkansen.

A 40cm snake inside a **carriage** on a Nagoya to Tokyo service in April last year caused **consternation** among passengers. Staff were unable to find the creature, and the carriage was replaced, resulting in a 17-minute delay.

In 2009, an electricity outage was also caused by a snake climbing on to power lines, stopping trains between Tokyo and **Fukushima**.

#### [2025-05-01 Japanese police arrest man after alleged car attack on schoolchildren, say reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/man-arrested-in-japan-after-allegedly-driving-a-car-into-schoolchildren-say-reports)

Police in the Japanese city of Osaka have arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder after he drove his car into seven schoolchildren, according to local media.

The children were walking home from school when the suspect appeared to deliberately drive the car at them on a quiet residential street at about 1.30pm local time, the public broadcaster NHK reported.

A seven-year-old girl suffered a broken jaw and the other children – boys and girls aged seven and eight – are reported to have relatively light injuries. All appeared to be **conscious** as they were taken to hospital.

Police arrested Yuki Yazawa, 28, an unemployed man from Higashimurayama city in Tokyo, at the scene. It is not clear why he was in Osaka.

“I was just sick of everything so I decided to drive my car into the elementary school students to kill them,” Yazawa told police, according to NHK.

Teachers from the primary school are reported to have pulled the suspect out of the car, where he had remained after driving into the children.

A mother in her 20s who had come to pick up her son, and who saw the attack, told NHK: “The car was being driven **erratically**, and it seems that it continued to move forward even after it had hit the children.

“My son was very shocked and has been crying the whole time. He only just started elementary school last month, and then something like this happened. It’s scary. I saw the man who had been driving the car. He was very quiet and appeared to be in a **daze**.”

Another witness told NHK that the car reversed back into the children after crashing into them.

An elementary school pupil told another news outlet, MBS News, that the man in the car had been “driving unsteadily”.

“I was walking along the side of the road and the car and suddenly it almost drove into us. The second and third graders in front of me were injured and were bleeding from their heads after being trapped between the car and the wall,” the pupil said.

A white SUV that appeared to be the one used by the suspect was being examined by police.

#### [2025-05-02 ‘For a better life’: CIA releases videos to lure disgruntled CCP officials to spy on China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/cia-china-videos-communist-party-spying-recruitment)

The CIA is on a **recruitment drive** for foreign spies. In their sights are Chinese officials and workers, who the US intelligence agency hopes to turn against Beijing via some newly released **glossy** videos.

The two videos touch on probable **anxieties** among some inside the Communist party machine – getting stuck in a lowly job assisting an increasingly wealthy corrupt official, or becoming victim to the endless purges that have targeted millions of party members at all levels since Xi Jinping came to power.

“As I rise within the party, I watch those above me being discarded like worn-out shoes, but now I realise that my fate was just as precarious as theirs,” a **narrator** says in one video, adding that he must protect his family whose fate is tied to his.

In another, the narrator declares: “Our leaders’ failure to fulfil repeated promises of prosperity has become a well-known secret … It’s time I start working towards my own dreams.”

The two Chinese-language videos released on Thursday come as trade hostilities between the two superpowers continue to spiral. Accessible on Youtube, they are titled in Chinese: “Why I contacted the CIA: to take control of my fate” and “Why I contacted the CIA: for a better life”.

“Do you have any information about economic, fiscal, or trade policies?” the CIA asks in the **caption**.

“Do you work in the defence industry? Do you work in national security, diplomacy, science, advanced technology, or deal with people who work in these fields? Please contact us. The information you can provide is important and we value your **insights** on these topics.”

The videos end with encrypted contact information for the agency.

The campaign follows earlier efforts which began in October, with instructions posted online for potential assets in China, Iran and North Korea to get in touch with the CIA. The agency has said it has had previous success **enlisting** Russians.

“If it weren’t working, we wouldn’t be making more videos,” a CIA official told Reuters, which said officials were confident the videos were getting past China’s strict internet controls.

In recent weeks Russian military recruitment videos have spread across Chinese social media, looking for mercenaries to fight in its war on Ukraine, but it’s not clear if Chinese authorities have allowed those videos to spread or simply been unable to stop them.

The CIA has a particular focus on rebuilding an espionage network inside China. A couple of years before Xi came to power in 2012, China’s ministry of state security reportedly dismantled a US spy ring, jailing and **executing** at least a dozen CIA **assets**.

In return, China has strengthened anti-espionage laws and encouraged citizens to carefully monitor and report the suspicious activities of those around them.

The US now considers China to be its most serious military and cyber threat.

“It is intent on dominating the world economically, militarily, and technologically,” CIA director John Ratcliffe said in a statement. “Our agency must continue responding to this threat with urgency, creativity, and **grit**, and these videos are just one of the ways we are doing this.”

#### [2025-05-06 Pakistan decries ‘act of war’ as it retaliates against India missile attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/pakistan-vows-to-retaliate-after-wave-of-indian-missiles-hit-country)

At least 26 people, including several children, have been killed and 46 injured after India launched attacks on what it claimed were nine sites of “terrorist infrastructure” inside Pakistan, in a sharp escalation of hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

Pakistan declared the strikes to be an “**act of war**” and claimed it had shot down five Indian air force jets and a drone. “Pakistan gives a **befitting** reply to India,” said the Pakistan government in a statement.

India had accused Pakistan of involvement in an attack targeting Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir last month that killed 26 people. “We are **living up to** the commitment that those responsible for this attack will be held accountable,” said the Indian defence ministry.

One Indian missile strike hit a **mosque** in the city of Bahawalpur in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, killing 13 people, including two three-year-old girls. Other locations hit were near Muridke in Punjab and Kotli in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, where a strike on a mosque killed several people, including a 16-year-old girl.

In a press conference held by the Indian army on Wednesday morning, it claimed the **overnight** strikes had targeted “terrorist training camps” and “terrorists likely to be sent across to India”, mostly associated with the Islamist militant groups Lashkar-e-Taib and Jaish-e-Mohammed.

Speaking at the press conference, Col Sudhir Chamoli **alleged** that Indian intelligence had uncovered evidence that “further attacks against India were **impending**” and said India needed to “both to deter and pre-empt”.

“These actions were measured, not escalatory, **proportionate** and responsible,” Chamoli said of the Indian strikes.

However, Pakistan denied that any of the sites hit by missiles had been associated with terrorist infrastructure, calling the allegations “unsubstantiated and unreasonable”, and said six civilian areas had been targeted.

Pakistan said the strikes had been carried out from the Indian side of the border. “At no time any of their aircraft were allowed to enter into Pakistan’s airspace and also at no time, none of Pakistan’s aircraft went into Indian airspace,” said Gen Ahmed Chaudhry, the director general of Pakistan’s **inter-services** public relations, the media wing of the military.

He said the Indian jets had been shot down by the Pakistan air force “when they attacked Pakistan, only after they released their weapons”.

Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, vowed to retaliate. “Pakistan has every right to respond forcefully to this act of war imposed by India, and a forceful response is being given,” he said. “The Pakistani nation and the Pakistan armed forces know very well how to deal with the enemy. We will never let the enemy succeed in its nefarious objectives.”

In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, after Sharif convened a meeting of the national security council, Pakistan emphasised its right to “**avenge** the loss of innocent Pakistani lives and **blatant** violation of its sovereignty” and said the military had been authorised to take action to do so.

The missile attacks were reported at about 1am local time. Pictures shared on social media showed the bloody body of a dead child and a seriously injured adult lying on **stretchers**. In a video shared widely on X, a huge blast can be seen lighting up the night sky as smoke billows into the air.

Residents in the Kupwara district of Indian-administered Kashmir reported heavy exchanges of fire between Indian and Pakistani troops on the line of control all through the night. The Indian army said that at least seven civilians had died and five had been injured in the cross-border shelling. On the Pakistan side, they said five civilians, including a five-year-old, had been killed.

According to reports, at least three Indian air force planes were brought down over Indian-administered Kashmir. In the village of Wuyan, Adnan Ahmad, 25, reported hearing a loud crash at about 1.40am.

“When I rushed to window I saw an aircraft in flames falling down,” he said. “There was another aircraft moving above the falling aircraft. The aircraft landed near a school building hitting trees. I rushed to the crash spot along with other neighbours. There were multiple explosions from the fallen wreckage for around an hour.”

There was no immediate comment from India on the reports of the downed military aircraft. Local people reported that pieces of the aircraft were **scattered** throughout the village and there was a strong smell of jet fuel.

On Wednesday morning, police and authorities blocked access to the main area of the crash as they cleared the wreckage. Sources said the pilot had **ejected** safely and was being treated at a nearby army hospital.

The strikes, carried out as part of “Operation Sindhoor”, were met with a **chorus** of approval across political lines in India. “The world must show zero tolerance for terrorism,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, while the defence minister, Rajnath Singh, wrote on X: “Victory to Mother India”. Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the opposition Congress party, said India was “extremely proud of our Indian armed forces … We applaud their resolute **resolve** and courage”.

Several major airlines said they were suspending flights to Pakistan and over **swathes of** northern India until midday local time on Wednesday.

The escalation comes amid soaring tensions between the neighbours in the aftermath of the attack in the Baisaran Valley, a **picturesque** **meadow** in Pahalgam, a well-known tourist town in Kashmir.

India blamed Pakistan for the attack, accusations Pakistan rejected. The two sides have exchanged nightly gunfire since 24 April along the line of control.

Wednesday’s missile strikes are a dangerous **heightening** of tension between the south Asian neighbours, who have fought multiple wars since they were carved out of British colonial India in 1947.

For days, the international community has piled pressure on Pakistan and India to step back from the brink of war. A UN spokesperson said that António Guterres, the UN secretary general, was “very concerned” about the Indian strikes across the international border and the line of control.

“He calls for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” the spokesperson said.

#### [2025-05-07 Xi Jinping to begin four-day Russia visit after Ukrainian drones attack Moscow](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/07/xi-jinping-begins-russia-visit-china-ukrainian-drones-moscow)

Xi Jinping is flying to Moscow for the start2 of a four-day visit during which he will attend Russia’s military **parade** **commemorating** the anniversary of the end of the second world war, known in Russia as Victory Day.

The Chinese leader’s trip has **coincided with** mass Ukrainian drone attacks on the Russian capital. Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said Russia’s air defence units destroyed at least 19 Ukrainian drones overnight.

The attacks forced most of Moscow’s airports to close and Russia’s national carrier Aeroflot said it was reordering timetables to cope with the **disruption**.

The wave of drones launched by Kyiv to disrupt the Kremlin’s preparations for Victory Day forced at least one world leader to divert his flight to Moscow on Wednesday, with the Serbian president’s plane rerouted to Baku, Azerbaijan.

Aleksandar Vučić’s visit to Moscow, for which he has been heavily criticised by several major European capitals, had already faced complications after Latvia and Lithuania reportedly barred his plane from their airspace, forcing a significant **detour**.

Russia’s defence ministry said the Russian military had shot down more than 500 drones in the past 24 hours, while airport **closures** affected at least 60,000 passengers.

Xi’s visit, which comes as China is engaged in a trade war with the US and soon after Ukraine has accused China of directly aiding Russia’s invasion, underscores his close relationship with Vladimir Putin. It is Xi’s 11th visit to Russia – more than to any other country – since becoming president.

The Russian foreign ministry described the trip as “one of the **central** events in Russian-Chinese relations this year”. Xi is expected to sign numerous cooperation agreements, deepening the “no limits” relationship between China and Russia. There will also be discussion of the planned Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, which could carry 50bn cubic metres of gas a year from Russia to China.

Xi is expected to hold talks with Putin on Thursday and to attend the Victory Day parade on Friday. China’s People’s Liberation Army will send an **honour guard** to participate in the ceremony in Moscow for the first time since 2015, and for the first time ever will send an honour guard to join in parallel celebrations in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.

In an article published on Wednesday, Xi wrote: “China and Russia are both major countries with significant influence and are constructive forces in maintaining global strategic stability and improving global governance … Together we must **foil** all schemes to disrupt or undermine our **bonds** of **amity** and trust”.

Bilateral trade between China and Russia has reached record levels since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, providing Moscow with an economic lifeline at a time when western countries have imposed sanctions on it. Trade reached $245bn (£183bn) in 2024, 66% more than in 2021.

China maintains it is a neutral party in the war and that it supports a peaceful resolution to the conflict. But in recent months Kyiv has been increasingly **outspoken** about what it says is China’s direct aid for Moscow’s war efforts.

Two Chinese mercenaries, out of hundreds who have travelled to fight with the Russian army, were caught in the eastern Donetsk region last month. They did not have a direct link to the Chinese state but recruitment videos are easily found on China’s tightly controlled social media.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused China of turning a blind eye to the participation of its nationals in the war.

Zelenskyy has criticised foreign leaders for travelling to Moscow, warning that Ukraine “cannot bear responsibility for what happens” to any heads of state attending the Victory Day parade.

Moscow has said that 29 world leaders are expected to attend the Victory Day commemorations, marking the largest foreign delegation at the Red Square parade since Putin launched his full-scale invasion more than three years ago.

#### [2025-05-08 Taiwan president says country faces similar threat to Europe before WW2](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/taiwan-president-europe-second-world-war)

Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has compared his nation to the European countries **heading for** conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, in a **punchy** speech commemorating the end of the second world war in Europe.

“Eighty years after the end of the European war, the **message** of history is clear. Today, 80 years later, we **share** the same values ​​and face similar challenges as many of the democracies that participated in the European war,” Lai said to a group of foreign **dignitaries** gathered in Taipei.

Lai’s speech comes at a time when Taiwan is facing increasing military pressure from China. It is the first time Taiwan has officially commemorated the end of the second world war.

The conflict is a **thorny** topic in cross-strait relations. China at the time was ruled by the Kuomintang, or the nationalists, under the **banner** of the Republic of China. During the war, the Kuomintang fought alongside the Chinese Communist party (CCP) against the Japanese, before resuming their own civil conflict, which led to the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 and establishing the Republic of China there. This remains the island’s official name. The CCP established the People’s Republic of China in Beijing.

In a **veiled reference** to China, Lai called on “freedom-loving people and countries” to work together to counter authoritarian regimes.

“Taiwan and Europe are jointly facing the threat of a new **totalitarian** group,” Lai said. “The bitter experience of world war two tells us that **appeasement** will only make the invaders more greedy and expand their ambitions.”

Thursday’s event opened with a short video **featuring** clips of the D-day landings in Normandy and audio recordings of Winston Churchill’s famous “We shall fight on the beaches” speech. The top British representative in Taiwan, Ruth Bradley-Jones, spoke at the event, as did Lutz Güllner, the head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan

Marcin Jerzewski, the head of the Taiwan office of the European Values Center for Security Policy, said Lai was “trying to send the message that security and prosperity of Taiwan and Europe are still **interconnected**, so that European partners fearing possible withdrawal of American security guarantees from Europe don’t turn away from their engagements with the Indo-Pacific and security in the Taiwan Strait.”

Lai is **steering** Taiwan through a fraught geopolitical moment. The self-governing island is claimed by China, which has vowed to annex it with the use of force if necessary. Since Donald Trump took office as US president in January, the commitment of the US, Taiwan’s main security backer, to helping Taiwan defend itself has been unclear.

China frequently **rehearses** blockades of Taiwan. So-called “greyzone” tactics such as disinformation campaigns have been increasing.

Wen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said Lai also wanted to show that “Taiwan wants to be a partner, not just a recipient, of western **largesse**”.

Lai’s speech came the day after China’s president, Xi Jinping, arrived in Moscow for Russia’s commemoration of the end of the second world war, which will be marked with a military parade featuring Chinese troops on Friday.

China’s ongoing support for Russia’s war in Ukraine has alarmed western leaders and raised concerns that China could be learning lessons for an invasion of Taiwan.

In an article published in Russian media on Wednesday about Chinese and Soviet cooperation during the second world war, Xi **devoted** a **lengthy** section to the war’s **implications** for China’s claims on Taiwan.

Xi described this week’s commemorations as “the 80th anniversary of Taiwan’s recovery” to China. “No matter how the situation on the island of Taiwan changes, no matter how external forces disrupt it, the historical trend that China will eventually reunify and will definitely reunify is unstoppable,” Xi wrote.

Xi expressed China’s appreciation for Russia’s support for “all measures taken by the Chinese government and people to achieve national reunification”.

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin exchanged warm words in the Kremlin on Thursday during a **grand** ceremony welcoming the Chinese leader for his 11th visit to Russia.

Xi said the Sino-Russian relationship was “confident, stable and **resilient**” in the new era and that China was willing to work with Russia to promote a multipolar world.

Putin described his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”, while Xi described Putin as his “old friend”.

Xi said: “History and reality have fully proven that the continued development and deepening of China-Russia relations is a natural **continuation** of the longstanding friendship between our peoples.”

Xi is in Moscow for the 80th anniversary celebrations of the end of the second world war, which is commemorated in Russia as Victory Day on 9 May.

World leaders flying into Moscow for the event faced the threat of disruption from Ukrainian drone attacks, which forced most of the Russian capital’s airports to close on Wednesday. The flight of the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, was rerouted.

Xi, whose plane was escorted by Russian fighter jets, was greeted on Wednesday by a military band playing the national **anthems** of Russia and China.

A three-day ceasefire declared by Russia to coincide with the celebrations appears to have held, with the Ukrainian air force saying no Russian missiles or drones had been detected in Ukrainian airspace as of 8am local time on Thursday.

Xi is expected to sign several cooperation agreements with Putin during his four-day visit, deepening China and Russia’s already “no limits” friendship.

In an article published in Russian media on Wednesday, Xi said China and Russia had fought side by side in the second world war. “Today, 80 years later, **unilateralism**, hegemony and bullying are extremely harmful,” Xi wrote. “We must learn from history … [and] **resolutely** oppose all forms of hegemony and power politics, and jointly create a better future for mankind.”

On Thursday he said the world was facing “unilateralism and acts of **hegemonic** bullying in the international **arena**”, a veiled reference to the US-China trade war, in which China has accused the US of coercive behaviour.

Hopes in some Washington **circles** that the Trump administration might have been able to perform a “reverse Nixon” and persuade Russia to decouple with China by **bolstering** the US-Russia relationship appear to have failed with Xi and Putin’s declaration that their countries are closer than ever before.

China has been an economic lifeline to Russia during the war in Ukraine, and in recent weeks Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China’s direct aiding of Moscow’s war effort.

The comments from Xi and Putin came a few hours after Lai Ching-te, the president of Taiwan, gave a punchy speech in Taipei calling on European leaders to stand with Taiwan in the face of “a new totalitarian group”, a veiled reference to China and its allies. Lai compared Taiwan’s current **predicament** to that of European countries before the start of the second world war.

Xi has used this visit to underscore Russia’s support for China’s claims on Taiwan. “Russia has repeatedly reiterated that it adheres to the one-China principle, that Taiwan is an **inalienable** part of China’s territory, opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence’, and firmly supports all measures taken by the Chinese government and people to achieve national reunification,” Xi wrote on Wednesday.

Western leaders are increasingly worried that China could launch some form of assault on Taiwan in the next few years, with the war in Ukraine providing a blueprint for how such an attack might **play out** on the world stage.
