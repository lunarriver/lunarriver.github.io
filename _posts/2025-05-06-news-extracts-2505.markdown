#### [2025-05-01 Snake on a train line: Japan’s busiest bullet train route brought to a halt](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/japan-snake-bullet-train)

Japan’s busiest bullet train line was brought to a halt on Wednesday after a metre-long snake wrapped itself around a power line, **shorting** the electricity supply and **stranding** hundreds of passengers.

**Shinkansen** trains running between Tokyo and **Osaka** were brought to a **standstill** by the snake, with news reports showing footage of people inside trains waiting for services to resume. Power did not appear to have been cut inside trains, with lights and air conditioning still functioning, according to passengers.

The **outage** happened at 5.25pm between Maibara and Gifu-Hashima stations, after the snake appeared to have climbed an electricity **pole**, meeting its **demise** as it attempted to **slither** along the overhead line. Power was not restored until after 7pm.

The Golden Week series of national holidays began on Wednesday, with millions on the move across Japan, returning to home towns and taking family vacations. In addition, the Osaka Expo 2025, which opened mid-April and runs until October, is attracting even more people than usual to the city.

“I use the shinkansen several times a month, but this is the first time I have experienced suspensions due to a power outage,” Satoshi Tagawa, 46, who was returning to Tokyo, told Kyodo News.

The line connects Tokyo, **Nagoya** and Osaka with more than 370 trains daily carrying an average of 430,000 passengers. Reaching speeds of up 285km per hour, it takes less than two and a half hours to Osaka from the Japanese capital.

More than 7 billion passengers have ridden the tokaido shinkansen since it opened as Japan’s first high-speed rail line just before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. It has an **exemplary** safety record, with not a single injury or accident recorded, and trains running to within an average of 1.6 minutes of their scheduled times, according to operator Central Japan Railway Co. (JR Tokai).

However, it is not the first time reptiles have delayed shinkansen.

A 40cm snake inside a **carriage** on a Nagoya to Tokyo service in April last year caused **consternation** among passengers. Staff were unable to find the creature, and the carriage was replaced, resulting in a 17-minute delay.

In 2009, an electricity outage was also caused by a snake climbing on to power lines, stopping trains between Tokyo and **Fukushima**.

#### [2025-05-01 Japanese police arrest man after alleged car attack on schoolchildren, say reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/man-arrested-in-japan-after-allegedly-driving-a-car-into-schoolchildren-say-reports)

Police in the Japanese city of Osaka have arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder after he drove his car into seven schoolchildren, according to local media.

The children were walking home from school when the suspect appeared to deliberately drive the car at them on a quiet residential street at about 1.30pm local time, the public broadcaster NHK reported.

A seven-year-old girl suffered a broken jaw and the other children – boys and girls aged seven and eight – are reported to have relatively light injuries. All appeared to be **conscious** as they were taken to hospital.

Police arrested Yuki Yazawa, 28, an unemployed man from Higashimurayama city in Tokyo, at the scene. It is not clear why he was in Osaka.

“I was just sick of everything so I decided to drive my car into the elementary school students to kill them,” Yazawa told police, according to NHK.

Teachers from the primary school are reported to have pulled the suspect out of the car, where he had remained after driving into the children.

A mother in her 20s who had come to pick up her son, and who saw the attack, told NHK: “The car was being driven **erratically**, and it seems that it continued to move forward even after it had hit the children.

“My son was very shocked and has been crying the whole time. He only just started elementary school last month, and then something like this happened. It’s scary. I saw the man who had been driving the car. He was very quiet and appeared to be in a **daze**.”

Another witness told NHK that the car reversed back into the children after crashing into them.

An elementary school pupil told another news outlet, MBS News, that the man in the car had been “driving unsteadily”.

“I was walking along the side of the road and the car and suddenly it almost drove into us. The second and third graders in front of me were injured and were bleeding from their heads after being trapped between the car and the wall,” the pupil said.

A white SUV that appeared to be the one used by the suspect was being examined by police.

#### [2025-05-02 ‘For a better life’: CIA releases videos to lure disgruntled CCP officials to spy on China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/cia-china-videos-communist-party-spying-recruitment)

The CIA is on a **recruitment drive** for foreign spies. In their sights are Chinese officials and workers, who the US intelligence agency hopes to turn against Beijing via some newly released **glossy** videos.

The two videos touch on probable **anxieties** among some inside the Communist party machine – getting stuck in a lowly job assisting an increasingly wealthy corrupt official, or becoming victim to the endless purges that have targeted millions of party members at all levels since Xi Jinping came to power.

“As I rise within the party, I watch those above me being discarded like worn-out shoes, but now I realise that my fate was just as precarious as theirs,” a **narrator** says in one video, adding that he must protect his family whose fate is tied to his.

In another, the narrator declares: “Our leaders’ failure to fulfil repeated promises of prosperity has become a well-known secret … It’s time I start working towards my own dreams.”

The two Chinese-language videos released on Thursday come as trade hostilities between the two superpowers continue to spiral. Accessible on Youtube, they are titled in Chinese: “Why I contacted the CIA: to take control of my fate” and “Why I contacted the CIA: for a better life”.

“Do you have any information about economic, fiscal, or trade policies?” the CIA asks in the **caption**.

“Do you work in the defence industry? Do you work in national security, diplomacy, science, advanced technology, or deal with people who work in these fields? Please contact us. The information you can provide is important and we value your **insights** on these topics.”

The videos end with encrypted contact information for the agency.

The campaign follows earlier efforts which began in October, with instructions posted online for potential assets in China, Iran and North Korea to get in touch with the CIA. The agency has said it has had previous success **enlisting** Russians.

“If it weren’t working, we wouldn’t be making more videos,” a CIA official told Reuters, which said officials were confident the videos were getting past China’s strict internet controls.

In recent weeks Russian military recruitment videos have spread across Chinese social media, looking for mercenaries to fight in its war on Ukraine, but it’s not clear if Chinese authorities have allowed those videos to spread or simply been unable to stop them.

The CIA has a particular focus on rebuilding an espionage network inside China. A couple of years before Xi came to power in 2012, China’s ministry of state security reportedly dismantled a US spy ring, jailing and **executing** at least a dozen CIA **assets**.

In return, China has strengthened anti-espionage laws and encouraged citizens to carefully monitor and report the suspicious activities of those around them.

The US now considers China to be its most serious military and cyber threat.

“It is intent on dominating the world economically, militarily, and technologically,” CIA director John Ratcliffe said in a statement. “Our agency must continue responding to this threat with urgency, creativity, and **grit**, and these videos are just one of the ways we are doing this.”

#### [2025-05-06 Pakistan decries ‘act of war’ as it retaliates against India missile attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/pakistan-vows-to-retaliate-after-wave-of-indian-missiles-hit-country)

At least 26 people, including several children, have been killed and 46 injured after India launched attacks on what it claimed were nine sites of “terrorist infrastructure” inside Pakistan, in a sharp escalation of hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

Pakistan declared the strikes to be an “**act of war**” and claimed it had shot down five Indian air force jets and a drone. “Pakistan gives a **befitting** reply to India,” said the Pakistan government in a statement.

India had accused Pakistan of involvement in an attack targeting Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir last month that killed 26 people. “We are **living up to** the commitment that those responsible for this attack will be held accountable,” said the Indian defence ministry.

One Indian missile strike hit a **mosque** in the city of Bahawalpur in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, killing 13 people, including two three-year-old girls. Other locations hit were near Muridke in Punjab and Kotli in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, where a strike on a mosque killed several people, including a 16-year-old girl.

In a press conference held by the Indian army on Wednesday morning, it claimed the **overnight** strikes had targeted “terrorist training camps” and “terrorists likely to be sent across to India”, mostly associated with the Islamist militant groups Lashkar-e-Taib and Jaish-e-Mohammed.

Speaking at the press conference, Col Sudhir Chamoli **alleged** that Indian intelligence had uncovered evidence that “further attacks against India were **impending**” and said India needed to “both to deter and pre-empt”.

“These actions were measured, not escalatory, **proportionate** and responsible,” Chamoli said of the Indian strikes.

However, Pakistan denied that any of the sites hit by missiles had been associated with terrorist infrastructure, calling the allegations “unsubstantiated and unreasonable”, and said six civilian areas had been targeted.

Pakistan said the strikes had been carried out from the Indian side of the border. “At no time any of their aircraft were allowed to enter into Pakistan’s airspace and also at no time, none of Pakistan’s aircraft went into Indian airspace,” said Gen Ahmed Chaudhry, the director general of Pakistan’s **inter-services** public relations, the media wing of the military.

He said the Indian jets had been shot down by the Pakistan air force “when they attacked Pakistan, only after they released their weapons”.

Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, vowed to retaliate. “Pakistan has every right to respond forcefully to this act of war imposed by India, and a forceful response is being given,” he said. “The Pakistani nation and the Pakistan armed forces know very well how to deal with the enemy. We will never let the enemy succeed in its nefarious objectives.”

In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, after Sharif convened a meeting of the national security council, Pakistan emphasised its right to “**avenge** the loss of innocent Pakistani lives and **blatant** violation of its sovereignty” and said the military had been authorised to take action to do so.

The missile attacks were reported at about 1am local time. Pictures shared on social media showed the bloody body of a dead child and a seriously injured adult lying on **stretchers**. In a video shared widely on X, a huge blast can be seen lighting up the night sky as smoke billows into the air.

Residents in the Kupwara district of Indian-administered Kashmir reported heavy exchanges of fire between Indian and Pakistani troops on the line of control all through the night. The Indian army said that at least seven civilians had died and five had been injured in the cross-border shelling. On the Pakistan side, they said five civilians, including a five-year-old, had been killed.

According to reports, at least three Indian air force planes were brought down over Indian-administered Kashmir. In the village of Wuyan, Adnan Ahmad, 25, reported hearing a loud crash at about 1.40am.

“When I rushed to window I saw an aircraft in flames falling down,” he said. “There was another aircraft moving above the falling aircraft. The aircraft landed near a school building hitting trees. I rushed to the crash spot along with other neighbours. There were multiple explosions from the fallen wreckage for around an hour.”

There was no immediate comment from India on the reports of the downed military aircraft. Local people reported that pieces of the aircraft were **scattered** throughout the village and there was a strong smell of jet fuel.

On Wednesday morning, police and authorities blocked access to the main area of the crash as they cleared the wreckage. Sources said the pilot had **ejected** safely and was being treated at a nearby army hospital.

The strikes, carried out as part of “Operation Sindhoor”, were met with a **chorus** of approval across political lines in India. “The world must show zero tolerance for terrorism,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, while the defence minister, Rajnath Singh, wrote on X: “Victory to Mother India”. Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the opposition Congress party, said India was “extremely proud of our Indian armed forces … We applaud their resolute **resolve** and courage”.

Several major airlines said they were suspending flights to Pakistan and over **swathes of** northern India until midday local time on Wednesday.

The escalation comes amid soaring tensions between the neighbours in the aftermath of the attack in the Baisaran Valley, a **picturesque** **meadow** in Pahalgam, a well-known tourist town in Kashmir.

India blamed Pakistan for the attack, accusations Pakistan rejected. The two sides have exchanged nightly gunfire since 24 April along the line of control.

Wednesday’s missile strikes are a dangerous **heightening** of tension between the south Asian neighbours, who have fought multiple wars since they were carved out of British colonial India in 1947.

For days, the international community has piled pressure on Pakistan and India to step back from the brink of war. A UN spokesperson said that António Guterres, the UN secretary general, was “very concerned” about the Indian strikes across the international border and the line of control.

“He calls for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” the spokesperson said.

#### [2025-05-07 Xi Jinping to begin four-day Russia visit after Ukrainian drones attack Moscow](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/07/xi-jinping-begins-russia-visit-china-ukrainian-drones-moscow)

Xi Jinping is flying to Moscow for the start2 of a four-day visit during which he will attend Russia’s military **parade** **commemorating** the anniversary of the end of the second world war, known in Russia as Victory Day.

The Chinese leader’s trip has **coincided with** mass Ukrainian drone attacks on the Russian capital. Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said Russia’s air defence units destroyed at least 19 Ukrainian drones overnight.

The attacks forced most of Moscow’s airports to close and Russia’s national carrier Aeroflot said it was reordering timetables to cope with the **disruption**.

The wave of drones launched by Kyiv to disrupt the Kremlin’s preparations for Victory Day forced at least one world leader to divert his flight to Moscow on Wednesday, with the Serbian president’s plane rerouted to Baku, Azerbaijan.

Aleksandar Vučić’s visit to Moscow, for which he has been heavily criticised by several major European capitals, had already faced complications after Latvia and Lithuania reportedly barred his plane from their airspace, forcing a significant **detour**.

Russia’s defence ministry said the Russian military had shot down more than 500 drones in the past 24 hours, while airport **closures** affected at least 60,000 passengers.

Xi’s visit, which comes as China is engaged in a trade war with the US and soon after Ukraine has accused China of directly aiding Russia’s invasion, underscores his close relationship with Vladimir Putin. It is Xi’s 11th visit to Russia – more than to any other country – since becoming president.

The Russian foreign ministry described the trip as “one of the **central** events in Russian-Chinese relations this year”. Xi is expected to sign numerous cooperation agreements, deepening the “no limits” relationship between China and Russia. There will also be discussion of the planned Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, which could carry 50bn cubic metres of gas a year from Russia to China.

Xi is expected to hold talks with Putin on Thursday and to attend the Victory Day parade on Friday. China’s People’s Liberation Army will send an **honour guard** to participate in the ceremony in Moscow for the first time since 2015, and for the first time ever will send an honour guard to join in parallel celebrations in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.

In an article published on Wednesday, Xi wrote: “China and Russia are both major countries with significant influence and are constructive forces in maintaining global strategic stability and improving global governance … Together we must **foil** all schemes to disrupt or undermine our **bonds** of **amity** and trust”.

Bilateral trade between China and Russia has reached record levels since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, providing Moscow with an economic lifeline at a time when western countries have imposed sanctions on it. Trade reached $245bn (£183bn) in 2024, 66% more than in 2021.

China maintains it is a neutral party in the war and that it supports a peaceful resolution to the conflict. But in recent months Kyiv has been increasingly **outspoken** about what it says is China’s direct aid for Moscow’s war efforts.

Two Chinese mercenaries, out of hundreds who have travelled to fight with the Russian army, were caught in the eastern Donetsk region last month. They did not have a direct link to the Chinese state but recruitment videos are easily found on China’s tightly controlled social media.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused China of turning a blind eye to the participation of its nationals in the war.

Zelenskyy has criticised foreign leaders for travelling to Moscow, warning that Ukraine “cannot bear responsibility for what happens” to any heads of state attending the Victory Day parade.

Moscow has said that 29 world leaders are expected to attend the Victory Day commemorations, marking the largest foreign delegation at the Red Square parade since Putin launched his full-scale invasion more than three years ago.

#### [2025-05-08 Taiwan president says country faces similar threat to Europe before WW2](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/taiwan-president-europe-second-world-war)

Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has compared his nation to the European countries **heading for** conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, in a **punchy** speech commemorating the end of the second world war in Europe.

“Eighty years after the end of the European war, the **message** of history is clear. Today, 80 years later, we **share** the same values ​​and face similar challenges as many of the democracies that participated in the European war,” Lai said to a group of foreign **dignitaries** gathered in Taipei.

Lai’s speech comes at a time when Taiwan is facing increasing military pressure from China. It is the first time Taiwan has officially commemorated the end of the second world war.

The conflict is a **thorny** topic in cross-strait relations. China at the time was ruled by the Kuomintang, or the nationalists, under the **banner** of the Republic of China. During the war, the Kuomintang fought alongside the Chinese Communist party (CCP) against the Japanese, before resuming their own civil conflict, which led to the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 and establishing the Republic of China there. This remains the island’s official name. The CCP established the People’s Republic of China in Beijing.

In a **veiled reference** to China, Lai called on “freedom-loving people and countries” to work together to counter authoritarian regimes.

“Taiwan and Europe are jointly facing the threat of a new **totalitarian** group,” Lai said. “The bitter experience of world war two tells us that **appeasement** will only make the invaders more greedy and expand their ambitions.”

Thursday’s event opened with a short video **featuring** clips of the D-day landings in Normandy and audio recordings of Winston Churchill’s famous “We shall fight on the beaches” speech. The top British representative in Taiwan, Ruth Bradley-Jones, spoke at the event, as did Lutz Güllner, the head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan

Marcin Jerzewski, the head of the Taiwan office of the European Values Center for Security Policy, said Lai was “trying to send the message that security and prosperity of Taiwan and Europe are still **interconnected**, so that European partners fearing possible withdrawal of American security guarantees from Europe don’t turn away from their engagements with the Indo-Pacific and security in the Taiwan Strait.”

Lai is **steering** Taiwan through a fraught geopolitical moment. The self-governing island is claimed by China, which has vowed to annex it with the use of force if necessary. Since Donald Trump took office as US president in January, the commitment of the US, Taiwan’s main security backer, to helping Taiwan defend itself has been unclear.

China frequently **rehearses** blockades of Taiwan. So-called “greyzone” tactics such as disinformation campaigns have been increasing.

Wen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said Lai also wanted to show that “Taiwan wants to be a partner, not just a recipient, of western **largesse**”.

Lai’s speech came the day after China’s president, Xi Jinping, arrived in Moscow for Russia’s commemoration of the end of the second world war, which will be marked with a military parade featuring Chinese troops on Friday.

China’s ongoing support for Russia’s war in Ukraine has alarmed western leaders and raised concerns that China could be learning lessons for an invasion of Taiwan.

In an article published in Russian media on Wednesday about Chinese and Soviet cooperation during the second world war, Xi **devoted** a **lengthy** section to the war’s **implications** for China’s claims on Taiwan.

Xi described this week’s commemorations as “the 80th anniversary of Taiwan’s recovery” to China. “No matter how the situation on the island of Taiwan changes, no matter how external forces disrupt it, the historical trend that China will eventually reunify and will definitely reunify is unstoppable,” Xi wrote.

Xi expressed China’s appreciation for Russia’s support for “all measures taken by the Chinese government and people to achieve national reunification”.

#### [2025-05-08 Xi hails ‘confident’ China-Russia ties as Putin welcomes ‘dear friend’ to Kremlin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-china-russia-kremlin)

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin exchanged warm words in the Kremlin on Thursday during a **grand** ceremony welcoming the Chinese leader for his 11th visit to Russia.

Xi said the Sino-Russian relationship was “confident, stable and **resilient**” in the new era and that China was willing to work with Russia to promote a multipolar world.

Putin described his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”, while Xi described Putin as his “old friend”.

Xi said: “History and reality have fully proven that the continued development and deepening of China-Russia relations is a natural **continuation** of the longstanding friendship between our peoples.”

Xi is in Moscow for the 80th anniversary celebrations of the end of the second world war, which is commemorated in Russia as Victory Day on 9 May.

World leaders flying into Moscow for the event faced the threat of disruption from Ukrainian drone attacks, which forced most of the Russian capital’s airports to close on Wednesday. The flight of the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, was rerouted.

Xi, whose plane was escorted by Russian fighter jets, was greeted on Wednesday by a military band playing the national **anthems** of Russia and China.

A three-day ceasefire declared by Russia to coincide with the celebrations appears to have held, with the Ukrainian air force saying no Russian missiles or drones had been detected in Ukrainian airspace as of 8am local time on Thursday.

Xi is expected to sign several cooperation agreements with Putin during his four-day visit, deepening China and Russia’s already “no limits” friendship.

In an article published in Russian media on Wednesday, Xi said China and Russia had fought side by side in the second world war. “Today, 80 years later, **unilateralism**, hegemony and bullying are extremely harmful,” Xi wrote. “We must learn from history … [and] **resolutely** oppose all forms of hegemony and power politics, and jointly create a better future for mankind.”

On Thursday he said the world was facing “unilateralism and acts of **hegemonic** bullying in the international **arena**”, a veiled reference to the US-China trade war, in which China has accused the US of coercive behaviour.

Hopes in some Washington **circles** that the Trump administration might have been able to perform a “reverse Nixon” and persuade Russia to decouple with China by **bolstering** the US-Russia relationship appear to have failed with Xi and Putin’s declaration that their countries are closer than ever before.

China has been an economic lifeline to Russia during the war in Ukraine, and in recent weeks Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China’s direct aiding of Moscow’s war effort.

The comments from Xi and Putin came a few hours after Lai Ching-te, the president of Taiwan, gave a punchy speech in Taipei calling on European leaders to stand with Taiwan in the face of “a new totalitarian group”, a veiled reference to China and its allies. Lai compared Taiwan’s current **predicament** to that of European countries before the start of the second world war.

Xi has used this visit to underscore Russia’s support for China’s claims on Taiwan. “Russia has repeatedly reiterated that it adheres to the one-China principle, that Taiwan is an **inalienable** part of China’s territory, opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence’, and firmly supports all measures taken by the Chinese government and people to achieve national reunification,” Xi wrote on Wednesday.

Western leaders are increasingly worried that China could launch some form of assault on Taiwan in the next few years, with the war in Ukraine providing a blueprint for how such an attack might **play out** on the world stage.

#### [2025-05-09 China and Russia pledge to deepen ties as they criticise US on Victory Day](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/09/china-russia-ties-criticise-us-victory-day)

China and Russia pledged to further deepen their already “no limits” partnership in a joint statement published ahead of Russia’s military parade on Friday, as the two sides stressed the importance of maintaining the “correct view” of second world war history.

In a lengthy statement published during Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow for the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which Russia celebrates on 9 May as Victory Day, Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin said “certain countries … are attempting to **tamper** with the results of the victory of the second world war”.

Xi is on his 11th visit to Russia since becoming president in 2013. On Thursday Xi and Putin held nearly four hours of talks in which both leaders described the other as a close friend. Putin announced plans to visit China in the autumn for the commemoration of Japan’s defeat in the second world war.

The Xi-Putin statement went further than previous ones in directly condemning the United States.

“The United States and its allies are trying to promote **Nato’s eastward expansion** into the Asia-Pacific region, build ‘small circles’ in the Asia-Pacific region, and **win over** countries in the region to promote their ‘Indo-Pacific strategy’, undermining regional peace, stability and prosperity,” the statement read.

China has long **sympathised** with Russia’s argument that Nato expansion in Europe was a threat to its security.

The statement also said that “unilateral coercive measures, including economic sanctions, that **bypass** the UN security council violate the UN Charter and other international laws and undermine international security interests”.

China is fighting an escalating trade war with the US that has rocked global markets since US president Donald Trump took office in January. China and the US are due to hold preliminary talks on de-escalating the tariffs this weekend. Meanwhile, Russia is under pressure from the US to pursue peace talks in Ukraine. This week’s meeting of the Chinese and Russian leaders underscores the close relationship between the two men who see themselves as a **bulwark** against US hegemony.

Earlier this week Xi claimed that the second world war also represented the “liberation” of Taiwan and marked “Taiwan’s return to China”. The Chinese Communist party claims Taiwan as part of its territory but it has never ruled over the island. The Republic of China fled there in 1949 after being defeated by the communists in the Chinese civil war. China has vowed to annex the island, by force if necessary, and Xi has made it clear that he sees resolving the “Taiwan problem” as an important part of his legacy.

The joint Xi-Putin statement stated that Russia “firmly supports the measures taken by the Chinese government to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and achieve national reunification”.

Although China and Russia do not have a normal military alliance, there are growing concerns in the west about the close security cooperation between the two countries. China and Russia conducted 14 joint military exercises in 2024, according to data **compiled** by the ChinaPower project, which tracks military and economic developments.

A Chinese honour guard will participate in Friday’s military parade in Moscow for the first time since 2015.

#### [2025-05-09 Chinese troops march with Russian forces as Xi joins Putin for Victory Day parade](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2025/may/09/chinese-troops-march-with-russian-forces-as-xi-joins-putin-for-victory-day-parade)

Russian troops fighting in Ukraine have marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater **spectacle** than in recent years.

After several **scaled-back** Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests – Vladimir Putin on Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

“The Soviet Union **took upon** itself the most **ferocious**, **merciless** **blows** of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine. “Truth and justice are on our side. The entire country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” Putin said, using the Kremlin’s preferred term to describe the war.

While Putin was **presiding** over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a **tribunal** for Russian war crimes. “Russia’s aggression cannot go unpunished and therefore establishing this tribunal is extremely important,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said during the visit.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he expected European leaders to visit Kyiv on Saturday, while European allies said at a meeting in Oslo that they supported an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine, something Moscow has been reluctant to agree to.

Moscow welcomed at least 27 foreign heads to the annual military parade, the highest number since 2015, including the leaders of Brazil, Slovakia and Serbia. The Kremlin presented the **turnout** as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine.

Other guests included leaders from fellow **autocracies** and pariah regimes, such as the military **juntas** from Myanmar and Burkina Faso.

Putin also thanked a visiting North Korean military delegation – a sign of deepening ties and new geopolitical realities after recent admissions from both sides that North Korean troops have been fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.

Presiding over the parade, Putin sat beside the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and was seen in frequent conversation with his most powerful ally. The two men held extensive talks before the parade, and their joint statement went further than previous statements in directly condemning the US.

The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was also in Moscow for the parade, and later on Friday met Putin. He criticised Donald Trump’s tariffs and pitched an expanded partnership with Moscow. “We have the chance at this historic moment to make our commercial relationship grow a lot,” he said.

This year’s parade featured an expanded military presence, with a fleet of tanks rolling across Red Square alongside rocket launchers, TOS-2 Tosochka heavy **flamethrower** systems and Iskander ballistic missiles – all weapons used in the war in Ukraine. For the first time, several types of modern Russian-made drones were also on display, underscoring their role as a **defining** feature of the conflict.

The **showcase** of weaponry marked a **stark** contrast to 2024’s **toned-down** parade, when a single Soviet-era tank rolled through Red Square. The shift is likely to **resonate** in European capitals, where officials have grown increasingly concerned about Moscow’s ability to **replenish** its military stockpiles and increase weapons production.

Over his two-and-a-half decades in power, Victory Day has emerged as the **centrepiece** of Putin’s vision of Russian identity. But since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Kremlin’s **mass** propaganda machine has given it new meaning, with Putin using the celebrations to justify the current war.

Seated not far from Putin were several high-profile veterans of the war in Ukraine, while Russian media reported that more than 1,500 troops who took part in the invasion participated in the march.

Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to **mobilise** support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader **resurrecting** nazism in Ukraine.

Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said: “Victory Day is by far the most important celebration for Putin – it’s an **ideological** event designed to rally the nation around him. The central message to the public is that the current ‘special military operation’ is a logical continuation of the Great Patriotic War.”

In a speech a day earlier, Zelenskyy condemned what he called Russia’s attempt to “**appropriate** Ukraine and distort history”, accusing the Kremlin of twisting the legacy of the second world war for propaganda purposes.

“Tomorrow, the organiser of the **mass graves** in Bucha will speak of Nazi atrocities. The architects of the Mariupol siege will invoke the siege of **Leningrad**. It will be a parade of **cynicism**, **bile**, and lies,” Zelenskyy said.

Despite the show of might on Red Square on Friday, there was widespread nervousness among Moscow’s political elite before the celebrations.

At the end of April, Putin announced a three-day unilateral ceasefire in Ukraine, starting on 8 May to coincide with the commemorations. Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as **self-serving** and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected.

In the **lead-up to** Victory Day, Ukraine significantly increased its drone attacks on Moscow and surrounding regions, causing airport closures and logistical chaos.

Zelenskyy also warned that Ukraine would provide no security guarantees to foreign guests attending the parade in Moscow. As many observers had predicted, Kyiv appeared to refrain from targeting Moscow on the day of the parade, probably owing to the presence of high-profile international dignitaries.

Still, fighting continued near the frontlines, with Moscow accusing Ukrainian forces of attempting to breach the border in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions.

This year’s parade comes at what many see as a crossroads moment for Moscow, as the Trump administration steps up its efforts to persuade Putin to end the war. There appears to be a growing recognition in the White House that the Kremlin is not ready to back down from its maximalist demands, including territorial claims over parts of Ukraine it does not control.

The US vice-president, JD Vance, echoed that frustration earlier this week, saying Russia was asking for “too much” in the talks, in the latest sign of Washington’s impatience with the negotiations.

Britain, France and a group of north European nations met in Oslo to discuss a route to a lasting peace in Ukraine. The Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, said that during a dinner on Thursday the leaders had phone contact with Trump and Zelenskyy, and were pushing for a full ceasefire. “That needs to be monitored and respected before you can move into the negotiations on the big issues to reach a lasting peace,” he said.

Kolesnikov said Putin appeared undecided about whether to enter into serious negotiations or continue the war in Ukraine, where Russian forces are making slow, grinding progress at a high human cost. “For now, he is stalling for time,” he said.

#### [2025-05-10 India and Pakistan agree Kashmir ceasefire but accuse each other of breaches](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/india-pakistan-immediate-us-mediated-ceasefire)

India and Pakistan have agreed to a US-mediated ceasefire with immediate effect, though its **longevity** was thrown into question after reports of cross-border shelling and explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir just hours after it was announced.

The ceasefire – which was hoped to end days of escalating clashes between the two nuclear-armed countries – was first declared by the US president, Donald Trump, on Saturday afternoon, after 48 hours of diplomacy between India and Pakistan, apparently brokered by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and vice-president, JD Vance.

Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

The ceasefire was later confirmed in a post on X by the Pakistani deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, who said the ceasefire would come in “with immediate effect”.

The Indian foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, said the heads of military operations from both countries had spoken on Saturday afternoon.

“It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, and in the air and sea. Instructions have been given on both sides to **give effect** to this **understanding**.” The top military officials would speak again on 12 May, Misri added.

However, the agreement was thrown into question after cross-border shelling restarted between the Indian and Pakistan armies on Saturday night. Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir, was also rocked by heavy explosions from projectiles that soared across the border.

On Saturday night, Misri said India’s armed forces had been given instructions to “deal strongly” with the violations.

An Indian government source told AFP that Pakistan had violated the ceasefire. A senior Pakistani security source said it was India that had started the ceasefire violations.

The Pakistani foreign ministry said in the early hours of Sunday that it “remains **committed to** **faithful** implementation” of the ceasefire it has agreed to with India.

Accusing India of committing its own violations, the Pakistani foreign ministry said its forces were “handling the situation with responsibility and restraint”. It continued: “We believe that any issues in smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. The troops on ground should also exercise restraint.”

Rubio said the ceasefire agreement had come after extensive negotiations by him and Vance with the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers, Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, and other top officials.

“I am pleased to announce the governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Rubio said on X.

“We commend prime ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, **prudence**, and **statesmanship** in choosing the path of peace,” he added.

News of the ceasefire was greeted with celebrations across India and Pakistan, particularly in Kashmir, the disputed region divided between the two countries that had been at the forefront of hostilities, with dozens killed in shelling over the border – known as the Line of Control (LoC) – in the past week.

In Uri, near the border in Indian-administered Kashmir, one of the worst-hit towns in the recent cross-border violence, Tanveer Chalko, 30, described scenes of **jubilation**.

“When news of the ceasefire broke, displaced families in camps began dancing with joy,” he said. “This is a great step towards peace and the welfare of the people. As a resident of a frontier area, I cannot put into words what this announcement means for us. Now everyone is preparing to return home.”

But Lal Din, 55, a resident of Poonch, a border town in Indian-administered Kashmir where many were killed and injured in this week’s violence along the LoC, said the news of the ceasefire was **bittersweet**. His home was destroyed in cross-border shelling and two of his relatives were killed.

“We’ve been here before – temporary ceasefires brokered by global powers. But until India and Pakistan seriously settle their disputes, we must brace for even greater conflicts,” he said.

However, those who gathered in the streets to celebrate were then driven indoors as explosions began to boom out over parts of Indian-Kashmir on Saturday night.

Historically, the US has played an important role as a mediator between India and Pakistan when hostilities have **flared** up. The Trump administration’s **proactive** role in brokering peace was, however, a notable reversal of Vance’s position 48 hours earlier, when he said the US would not intervene in the India-Pakistan conflict as it was “none of our business”.

The ceasefire appeared to give both sides the opportunity to walk away claiming victory. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and **manifestations**,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.

In Pakistan it was met with **a chorus of approval**. “Congratulations to the civil and military leadership for emerging out of the war with dignity, **professionalism** and national resolve **unequivocally** **intact**,” said the Pakistani senator Sherry Rehman.

The ceasefire came after India and Pakistan accused each other of cross-border missile strikes against significant military targets on Saturday, with many fearful it would escalate into **all-out** war. India and Pakistan have fought four wars, most recently in 1999.

The fighting this week was first **inflamed** on Wednesday after Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were in response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which it blamed on Pakistani-backed extremists.

The situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two **consecutive** nights of drone attacks. India claimed to have intercepted more than 400 drones targeting cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday. In retaliation, India said it had launched four drone strikes on Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure.

By Saturday morning, India had accused Pakistan of launching strikes on dozens of airbases and military headquarters across north India, using long-range weapons, drones and fighter aircraft. The accusations came a few hours after Pakistan said India had fired six surface-to-air missiles targeting three of Pakistan’s most important military bases early on Saturday morning. Both accused the other of firing cross-border missiles first.

#### [2025-05-12 Taiwan ex-president Tsai Ing-wen to visit UK as China ratchets up threats against Taipei](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/tsai-ing-wen-uk-visit-former-taiwan-president)

Former Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen will visit Britain this week at the invitation of British politicians, a trip that comes as London is trying to improve ties with Beijing and China ramps up efforts to diplomatically isolate the island.

Britain, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but the economic and political exchanges between the two sides have increased as Beijing ratchets up military threats to force Taipei to accept its sovereignty claim over the democratic island.

Tsai, who stepped down in May last year, has become a symbol of Taiwan’s defiance against China’s military threats. She is now in Lithuania and will travel to Denmark and then Britain later this week, her office said.

Tsai was invited by “friends in Britain’s parliament” in a trip that is designed to deepen friendship between Taiwan and Britain, the office said in a statement, adding Tsai, who has a **doctorate** from the London School of Economics, will meet unspecified British politicians.

Britain’s Foreign Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside office hours in London.

China’s foreign ministry also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tsai had been due to visit London in October last year, but that coincided with a trip to Beijing by British foreign secretary David Lammy at a time when London was trying to reset **strained** ties with China. Tsai did not **end up going**.

Tsai last year visited the **Czech** Republic, France, **Belgium** and Canada, drawing condemnation from Beijing which has repeatedly **denounced** Tsai as a “separatist”.

Despite a lack of formal ties, Taiwan sees Britain as an important democratic partner.

In 2023, Taiwan and Britain signed an Enhanced Trade Partnership Arrangement and Britain is also one of the countries that has helped Taiwan with its **indigenous** submarine programme, a vital part of Tsai’s push to boost Taiwan’s defence against China’s threat.

China says Taiwan is one of its provinces with no right to the **trappings** of a state, a position Taipei’s government strongly rejects.

#### [2025-05-12 Brazil’s president seeks ‘indestructible’ links with China amid Trump trade war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/brazil-china-trade-lula-da-silva-trump)

The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has **heralded** his desire to build “**indestructible**” relations with China, as the leaders of three of Latin America’s biggest economies flew to Beijing against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s trade war and the **profound** international uncertainty his presidency has generated.

Lula touched down in China’s capital on Sunday for a four-day state visit, accompanied by 11 ministers, top politicians and a delegation of more than 150 business leaders.

Hours later Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, arrived, making a **beeline** for the Great Wall of China and declaring his desire for the South American country to not “only look one way” towards the US. “We have decided to take a profound step forward between China and Latin America,” Petro said.

Chile’s Gabriel Boric has also travelled to Beijing to attend Tuesday’s meeting between members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) and Chinese representatives.

Addressing hundreds of Chinese and Brazilian business chiefs in the Chinese capital on Monday, Lula **hit out** at Trump’s tariffs, saying he could not accept the measures “that the president of the US tried to impose on planet Earth, **from one day to the next**”.

The Brazilian leftist said he hoped to build an “indispensable” relationship with China – already Brazil’s top trading partner – and **heaped** praise on his Communist party hosts as his officials announced $4.6bn (£3.5bn) of Chinese investment in their country. On Tuesday, Lula is scheduled to meet China’s leader, Xi Jinping, who is expected to return the visit in July, when Xi travels to the Brics summit in Rio.

“China has often been treated as though it were an enemy of global trade when actually China is behaving like an example of a country that is trying to do business with countries which, over the past 30 years, were forgotten by many other countries,” said Lula, who is expected to seek major Chinese investments in Brazilian infrastructure projects.

The visit of the three South American leaders to China underlines the east Asian country’s rapidly growing **footprint** in a region where, over the past 25 years, it has become a **voracious** consumer of commodities such as **soybeans**, **iron ore** and copper. Chinese companies have also **poured into** the region. Electric cars made by the Chinese manufacturer BYD can be seen **cruising** the streets of Brazilian cities, from Brasília to Boa Vista, deep in the Amazon.

The visits also come amid global **jitters** over Trump’s volatile presidency and Latin American anxiety and suspicion over the US president’s plans for a region where he has threatened to “take back” the Panama **canal** – by force if necessary.

Matias Spektor, an international relations professor at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, a Brazilian thinktank and university, said the presence of the three South American presidents in Beijing underscored how, in the Trump era, with the US in retreat, such leaders were increasingly reaching out to other parts of the world.

“It tells us that countries around the world are willing to go out … to exploit all the opportunities that are there in the international system – and there are many. Because, as America turns away from free trade and as America **adopts** a policy that is … instead of **transactional**, **predatory** – countries have an incentive to engage with those who are transactional,” Spektor said, pointing to recent trips Lula made to Japan and Vietnam.

“Lula is very proactively trying to open trade for Brazil at a time when America is **undoing** the previous rules of the game, and the new rules of the game are not yet born … These Latin American countries want to shape the norms that are likely to emerge now. And those rules are not going to emerge in Washington DC. They are going to be made globally,” Spektor added.

Spektor said Latin American leaders such as Lula had long considered the world a multipolar place. “What happened on 20 January with Trump’s return to power is that the **barrage** of policy change coming from Washington DC has accelerated the belief that was already in place that the axis of global power has for a while been moving towards the east, and somewhat towards the south.”

#### [2025-05-13 China cautiously welcomes pause in US tariff war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/13/china-cautiously-welcomes-pause-in-us-tariff-war)

A 90-day pause in the US-China tariff war has been cautiously welcomed in China but tensions remain high, with Xi Jinping again accusing the US of “bullying”.

After two days of talks between officials in Geneva over the weekend, China and the US agreed to **substantially** lower for the next 90 days the high tariffs each had imposed on the other in a tit-for-tat trade war.

Under the agreement, US duties on Chinese goods will be lowered from 145% to 30%, while China’s retaliatory tariffs on US imports will be lowered from 125% to 10%. China also removed a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing planes, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

Donald Trump hailed the talks as a “total reset” of the bilateral relationship but China’s responses made it clear that Beijing was still angry, and still blamed the US for **wreaking** economic chaos.

Meeting Latin American leaders in Beijing on Tuesday, Xi said there were “no winners in tariff wars or trade wars”.

“Bullying and hegemony will only lead to self-isolation,” he added, in reference to the US.

On Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry continued to condemn the “unreasonable” tariffs, urging the US to “stop smearing and **shifting blame**” for its fentanyl crisis on to China.

The imbalance of 10% and 30% under the agreement is because the US is keeping a 20% tariff linked to accusations that China turns a blind eye to exports of chemicals used to make fentanyl, which Beijing denies.

Chinese officials have repeatedly said Beijing opposes all tariffs and does not want to enter into a mutually **destructive** trade war but is willing to “fight to the end”.

An English-language editorial published across state media titles on Tuesday said the talks marked “a crucial step toward resolving differences”. It said China’s approach had been consistent and constructive, and it welcomed the US’s “willingness to engage in that process”.

“While we are glad to see the resumption of dialogue, we are also fully prepared for the long-term, complex and **arduous** **nature** of resolving differences between the two countries,” it said.

The tariff war has had an extraordinary impact on Chinese traders and manufacturers, with **shipments** grinding to a halt and an estimated 16m jobs at risk.

China now joins dozens of other countries in waiting to see if it can reach an agreement with the US not to restart **crushing** tariffs. On Monday, China’s commerce and finance ministries held discussions with foreign trade representatives about navigating the next three months and **weathering** the shocks of the tariffs.

Ms Bao, an assistant to the general manager of a Ningbo foreign trade company, said 30% of their **export volume** went to the US, and they were feeling cautiously optimistic about the 90-day pause.

“It’s hard to say what will happen after 90 days because we don’t know,” Bao told the Guardian. “There may be an increase in the volume of good shipping now because everyone may want to rush to ship the goods before the end of the 90 days.”

The Chinese business media outlet Caixin reported that some companies had already shifted their focus away from the US to domestic or other Asian markets instead.

On Chinese social media, where discussion of the agreement received more than half a billion engagements, views were split.

Hu Xijin, a former editor of the nationalist Chinese tabloid the Global Times, described the agreement as a “great victory for China in upholding the principles of equality and mutual respect”.

One reader commenting on the Paper’s report said: “**Persistence** is victory!”

Others were more **sarcastic** about the “victory”. “Oh, did we win again?” said one person on Weibo. “The stock indexes react like we just lose.”

On Xiaohongshu, China’s Instagram, a user likened the pause to “changing the **ventilator** … on a dying patient”. “He can breathe, but he’s still far from being able to walk **briskly**,” they wrote.

Other commenters compared the US to the boy who cried wolf and hoped that it wouldn’t “break its promises again and again”. One said: “Economically speaking, this is sort of a ceasefire.”
