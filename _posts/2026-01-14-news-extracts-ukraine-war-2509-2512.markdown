#### [Ukraine war briefing: Putin awards ‘courage’ medal to Russian general sought by ICC over alleged crimes against humanity in Ukraine | Ukraine | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/09/ukraine-war-briefing-putin-awards-courage-medal-to-russian-general-sought-by-icc-over-alleged-crimes-against-humanity-in-ukraine)

The Order of Courage, a prestigious state decoration, was given to him “for courage, bravery and **dedication** displayed in the fulfilment of military duty”, according to a decree published on Russia’s official legal acts website late on Monday.

While visiting the building, the European Union’s ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova, noted the “gaping hole” left by the impact and missile **remnants** and said: “It’s only because the missile was unable to fully **detonate** that the entire building wasn’t turned into ruins.”

He added: “I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it’s easy to become **desensitised** to what has been going on.”

The prince said he was initially invited to Kyiv by Olga Rudnieva, the founder and CEO of the Superhumans Trauma Centre in Lviv, Ukraine which treats wounded **amputees**.

While the **biennial** Invictus Games have been the focal point of much of the foundation’s work.

#### [Ukraine war briefing: ‘Wasn’t a mistake’ – Poland’s reply after Trump speculates on drones | Ukraine | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/12/ukraine-war-briefing-wasnt-a-mistake-polands-reply-after-trump-speculates-on-drones)

“We’re sanctioning actors involved in chemical weapons and disinformation, as well as shadow fleet vessels, alternative payment providers, and third-country **facilitators** in North Korea and Iran.”

#### [EU calls for closer ties with India despite Modi’s links to Russia | European Union | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/17/eu-calls-for-closer-ties-with-india-despite-modi-ties-to-russia)

Meanwhile the EU is **grappling** with demands from Trump to impose up to 100% tariffs on India and China, another buyer of Russian oil, to pressure Russia to end the war.

But privately, officials have **balked** at 100% tariffs, at a time when Brussels is also trying to sign a trade agreement with India by the end of the year.

#### [Ukraine war briefing: Russian oil system struggling under Ukrainian attacks – report | World news | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/17/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-oil-system-struggling-under-ukrainian-attacks-report)

Europe has in fact greatly reduced its purchase of Russian oil and gas, though two big **holdouts** are Hungary and Slovakia, whose rightwing prime ministers are both friendly with Putin and Trump.

The editorial listed how Trump’s promises and threats concerning the Ukraine war have all failed to produce results – including how “an 8 August deadline for Mr Putin to agree to a ceasefire somehow **morphed** into a red carpet welcome in Alaska”.

A Russian drone, missile or **glide** bomb hit an educational building in Kharkiv city’s southern Slobidskyi district on Tuesday. Some reports described the building as the pharmaceutical university.

A Ukrainian arrested in Italy last month over the 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines from Russia to Europe must be **extradited** to Germany, a court in Bologna ruled on Tuesday.

#### [Ukraine war briefing: Shoot down trespassing Russian jets if necessary – Czech president | Ukraine | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/ukraine-war-briefing-shoot-down-trespassing-russian-jets-if-necessary-czech-president)

Unfortunately, this is **teetering** on the edge of conflict, but giving in to evil is simply not an option.”

The special **rapporteur** on rights in Russia, Mariana Katzarova, denounces in her report “the continuing widespread and systematic recourse to torture and ill-treatment by Russian law enforcement officials, security forces, **penitentiary** officials and members of the armed forces”. The independent expert, who does not speak on behalf of the UN, said Russian authorities had “dismantled institutional independence, bringing the **judiciary**, legislature and law enforcement under direct political control.”

#### [UK and Poland vow to confront Russian aircraft violating Nato airspace | Russia | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/22/uk-and-poland-vow-to-confront-russian-aircraft-violating-nato-airspace)

He added: “Either Moscow wants to escalate and pull more countries into this conflict with Ukraine, or it doesn’t have full control of those who operate its fighter planes and drones. Either scenario is very **disconcerting**.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/23/hungary-refuses-to-stop-buying-russian-oil-despite-trumps-nato-demand

Hungary will not **wean** itself off Russian energy supplies, the country’s foreign minister has told the Guardian, despite the White House’s demand for Nato allies to stop buying Russian oil.

Some allies questioned whether he is serious about wanting to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin or merely passing the **buck** to Europe.

“I hope and expect them to **step up to the plate** soon to help us end this bloodbath.”

Asked about European pressure on Monday, Szijjártó called western European officials “**fanatics**” and said it was “totally impossible to carry out a fact-based, rational dialogue based on common sense”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/moscow-trump-change-in-tone-ukraine-war-paper-tiger

He warned that Vladimir Putin, **unchecked**, would use drones to expand his war throughout Europe.

Those that continued to fund the war **consigned** prisoners of war, abducted children and hostages to longer periods of captivity, he said.

Before Zelenskyy’s speech, Moscow had **brushed off** the shift in tone from Trump, including his claim Russia had been “fighting aimlessly for three and a half years”, a stark contrast to the red-carpet treatment he laid out for Putin at a summit in Alaska last month.

Peskov said the Russian army was making gains in Ukraine, **albeit** slowly.

Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president now better known for his **outlandish** rhetoric, wrote on Telegram that Zelenskyy had lured Trump into an “alternate reality” where Ukraine could win the war.

“Most likely he’ll soon tell Zelenskyy to sign an **act** of capitulation,” Medvedev wrote.

Also on Tuesday, Trump **berated** European countries for “embarrassing” purchases of Russian oil and gas, demanding they “immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia” or “otherwise we are all wasting a lot of time”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/is-trump-right-that-russian-economy-is-on-brink-of-collapse

Russia’s economy is in deep **peril**, Donald Trump assured the world this week.

“But a widening deficit, soaring defence **outlays** and shrinking revenues are making that choice harder,” Shagina added.

German Gref conceded earlier this month that Russia had slipped into “technical **stagnation**”.

To bolster state **coffers**, Moscow announced this week it would increase VAT from 20% to 22%, reversing one of Putin’s earlier promises. Russians will now finance the war more directly, with defence spending – **outstripping** the combined defence budgets of Europe – accounting for about 40% of the Kremlin’s total outlay this year.

The government is expected to cut spending **across the board** – from corporations to infrastructure, healthcare and housing – to plug the gap.

After the west weaned itself off Russian oil and gas, Moscow redirected its energy exports to India, China and Turkey, relying on a **flotilla** of “shadow fleet” tankers that proved difficult to bring under sanctions.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/27/putin-preparing-to-attack-another-european-country-zelenskyy-says

He told him Russia’s advances were often **fleeting**: “It’s not success. It’s temporary presence.”

The US president now had greater “faith” in Ukraine and has discovered that Russia treated him and everyone else with “disrespect”, Zelenskyy said. He declined to comment on reports that he had asked the White House for US **Tomahawk** cruise missiles capable of striking Moscow, saying: “It’s a sensitive issue.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/27/denmark-new-drone-sightings-biggest-military-base

Moscow has denied breaching Nato’s airspace, calling the EU’s reaction a “**hysteria**” on Wednesday.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/28/hundreds-of-russian-missiles-and-drones-hit-ukraine-as-poland-scrambles-jets

A missile wiped out most of a street in the Petropavlivska Borshchahivka district, **sheering** off roofs and blowing out windows.

Classmates left flowers and toys outside her **gutted** house.

Mark Serhiyiv, a 35-year-old army **chaplain**, said it was the second time Moscow had destroyed his home.

On Sunday morning in Kyiv firefighters **doused** a burning car. Rescue workers and a digger shovelled up glass, **masonry** and twisted **rebar**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/putin-russian-air-defences-azerbaijani-jet-crash

Vladimir Putin has said that Russia’s air defences were to blame for downing an Azerbaijani **jetliner** in December that killed 38 people.

Aliyev, meanwhile, criticised Moscow for trying to “**hush** up” the incident.

The controversy over the crash has **roiled** the previously warm ties between Moscow and Baku.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/ukraine-war-briefing-moscow-voices-extreme-concern-at-trump-threat-to-send-tomohawk-missiles-to-kyiv

Trump has been **mulling** potential supplies of the long-range missiles to Kyiv via European allies ever since his meeting with Putin in Alaska in August failed to produce a peace deal.

Kyiv regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said two employees of Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, were wounded in Russian strikes on a **substation**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/14/ukraine-war-briefing-crimea-oil-refinery-burns-as-russia-feels-effects-on-fuel-supply

The drones hit at least five **reservoirs**.

The first **corps** of Ukraine’s national guard said it had repelled a new attempt by Russian forces to make advances near the town of Dobropillia.

Martin Jaeger told lawmakers that Russia was determined to expand its “**sphere** of influence further westward into Europe”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-donbas-region-end-russia-invasion

“The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this, we take that,’” he said. “You know, there are so many different **permutations**.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/european-leaders-near-deal-to-use-frozen-russian-assets-for-ukraine

Under the plan – **sketched** out in a two-page document by the European Commission last month – the EU would give a €140bn interest-free loan to Ukraine based on the Russian frozen assets held at the Euroclear finance agency.

Belgium hosts €183bn of frozen assets at Brussels-based Euroclear, and has called for detailed guarantees that it will not be left alone with the bill, if the scheme collapses, triggering a slew of **legal claims**.

In an FT opinion article, Merz wrote that “a new **impetus** to change Russia’s calculations” was needed.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/ukraine-war-briefing-storm-shadow-missiles-hit-gunpowder-plant-in-russia

“A massive combined missile and airstrike was carried out, including with air-launched Storm Shadow missiles that **penetrated** Russia’s air defence system,” said Ukraine’s armed forces general staff.

Plans for a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Budapest have been **shelved**. “And I assume Lavrov gave the same **spiel**, and Rubio was like: ‘See you later’.”

Another said it would be **modelled** on the US 20-point plan on Gaza.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/ukraine-war-briefing-ukrainians-may-get-gripen-fighter-jets-bought-with-russian-money

The Gripen has long been **vaunted** as more practical for Ukrainian battlefield conditions.

Tymur Tkachenko said drones had damaged several **dwellings** and other buildings, including a kindergarten.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/will-us-sanctions-russia-oil-companies-be-effective-why-trump-now

It will **come down to** how aggressively the US enforces them.

Additional sanctions will help to further **constrict** Rosneft and Lukoil’s ability to do business, placing further pressure on Putin.

Thomas Graham, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, was more **circumspect**, telling Bloomberg: “If the White House thinks this is going to lead to radical change in the Kremlin’s conduct or Putin’s policy, they’re **deluding** themselves …”

Experts say that Trump’s campaign promise to keep petrol prices low and manage the cost of living crisis could **dilute** the impact of the new sanctions, if they start to dramatically affect the oil price.

Efforts to secure Tomahawk missiles at a White House meeting last week were **dashed** after Trump held a phone call with Putin.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/putin-says-he-will-never-bow-to-us-but-concedes-sanctions-may-cause-some-losses

Vladimir Putin has said Russia will never bow to US pressure but **conceded** new sanctions could cause some economic pain.

Several sources also told Reuters that China’s state-owned oil companies have suspended purchases of **seaborne** Russian crude, at least in the short-term, amid concerns about **falling foul of** the new sanctions.

Dmitry Medvedev, known for his increasingly **belligerent** rhetoric, described the measures as an “act of war”.

“Its talkative ‘peacemaker’ has now fully **embarked** on a path of war against Russia.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/27/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-claims-test-of-nuclear-powered-missile-known-as-flying-chornobyl

Depending on the design, it potentially **spews** out radioactive **exhaust** as it flies.

That November, awarding **posthumous** decorations to the victims’ families, Putin said they had been working on an “**unparalleled**” weapon.

Luke Wickenden said: “If Moscow lost access to these markets, it could **forfeit** approximately $7.4bn in monthly revenue, translating to roughly $3.6bn in tax **receipts** per month flowing directly into the Kremlin’s war chest.”

The US imposed sanctions and Donald Trump cancelled a **foreshadowed** meeting in Budapest with the Russian ruler. Kirill Dmitriev alleged there had been “**titanic** attempts” to thwart US-Russia dialogue. Trump initially gave a **glowing** assessment of his most recent conversation with Putin and said they would meet in Budapest.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/china-is-watching-finland-warns-defeating-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-key-to-stability-in-indo-pacific

“China is watching. Does the democratic countries will become **fed up**?

Ending the Ukraine conflict required a three-**pillar** approach, he said.

Cooperation on the war could have broader **flow-on** effects for Australia’s trade ties with Europe.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/ukraine-war-briefing-trump-not-really-considering-supplying-tomahawks

Whereas Russian crude amounted to virtually all of the STAR refinery’s crude **intake** in October and September of about 210,000 bpd.

Tupras was also likely soon to completely phase out Russian crude imports so that it could maintain fuel exports to Europe without **falling foul** of the EU’s incoming sanctions.

At least 200 Russian soldiers had **penetrated** Pokrovsk’s defences, Kyiv said last week, while the Institute for the Study of War assessed that others were closing in on its outskirts in a **pincer-shaped** movement.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-visits-troops-near-embattled-pokrovsk

Russian forces had pushed further into Pokrovsk and its **environs**.

The city administration reported an explosion at the Sterlitamak Petrochemical Plant that caused its water **treatment** facility to partially collapse. The Ukrainian military general staff said there was “**considerable** damage” to the plant.

Russian military **reservists** will now have to guard oil refineries against Ukrainian drone strikes after Vladimir Putin signed a law on Tuesday extending their **entanglement** in the war effort. The Russian ruler also signed a law allowing military **conscription** all year round whereas previously it was possible only during limited periods in autumn and spring.

Italy summoned Russia’s deputy ambassador on Tuesday to protest at what it said were “**vulgar**”, “disturbing” and “unacceptable” remarks by Moscow’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who linked the deadly collapse of a tower in Rome to Italy’s military support for Ukraine. “Italy will not alter its foreign policy stance or its principles in response to reckless **verbal** attacks”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/belgium-to-hold-security-meeting-after-drone-sightings-at-airports-and-military-bases

The skies were also closed over Liège airport, an important hub for **freight** transport, leading to further cancellations, delays and **diversions**.

Lithuania closed its two largest airports last month after **helium** balloons, suspected of carrying **contraband** cigarettes. Lithuania’s prime minister later called the **intrusions** “hybrid attacks” in an echo of the term used to describe destabilisation efforts by Moscow.

Belgium’s defence minister said the incidents appeared to be coordinated to **foment** disruption, involving large drones flying in **formation**.

Last week, Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev, known for his **bombastic** social media posts, called Francken an **imbecile**.

The **spat** came after Belgium disappointed EU allies by blocking a plan to loan Ukraine €140bn based on Russian frozen assets held in Brussels.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/ukraine-war-briefing-bulgaria-moves-to-seize-russian-refinery-while-poland-seeks-to-be-us-gas-conduit

With international action progressively choking off Russia’s **petroleum** exports, Poland said on Wednesday that it was working on a deal to import liquefied natural gas from the US to supply Ukraine and Slovakia.

Moscow’s forces appear to be tightening their grip on Pokrovsk, Pjotr Sauer reports, with street fighting **raging across** the ruined city in eastern Ukraine.

Emil Kastehelmi posted: “Ukraine may be repeating a **costly** mistake in Pokrovsk … seen for example in Vuhledar and Kursk – a reluctance to conduct a controlled, militarily **justified** withdrawal from a threatened salient when the situation no longer favours the defender.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/ukraine-war-briefing-top-bankers-straight-talk-to-putin-over-troubled-economy

His bank was experiencing only “very modest” growth due to “challenging macroeconomic conditions” including a **shrinkage** of its consumer loan **portfolio**. The Kremlin has **undertaken** an information campaign to portray the Russian economy as stable and strong.”

“Using its **numerical superiority** in personnel and materiel, the enemy advanced in fierce fighting and captured three settlements.”

These actions are part of a series of similar incidents and represent a **characteristic** of the war of aggression waged by Russia.”

“We are ready to discuss the suspicions,” Russia’s recently **reclusive** foreign minister told state media. “Other tests, both **subcritical**, or those without a **chain nuclear reaction**, and carrier tests, have never been prohibited,” Lavrov said.

The **knock-on** effects of the US sanctions on Russian oil companies have **upended** Russian investments in several countries.

The head of Ukraine’s delegation for talks with Russia said on Tuesday he was in Istanbul to try to “**unblock**” the process of prisoner swaps.

Ukraine’s prime minister said the government had dismissed Energoatom’s **supervisory board** while anti-corruption authorities said they had charged seven individuals over an alleged $100m **kickback** scheme involving the nuclear agency and other state enterprises.

The detainee has said he suffers from **pancreatitis** and **coeliac** disease and is **vegan**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/16/ukraine-war-briefing-drones-hit-russias-ryazan-oil-refinery

Russian officials often do not admit such attacks have succeeded, and the Ryazan governor, Pavel Malkov, **adopted the standard line** that Ukrainian drones were shot down but debris happened to hit the target.

The Serbian state holds nearly 30% of NIS, with the rest owned by minority **shareholders**.

Moscow seeks to **scupper** one of Kyiv’s key logistical systems. The rail network carries more than 63% of the country’s freight – including **grain** shipments – and 37% of passenger traffic.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced an **overhaul** of state-owned energy companies amid a corruption scandal. Anti-**graft** investigators allege around $100m has been **embezzled**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/ukrainians-working-for-russia-rail-blasts-says-poland-prime-minister-donald-tusk

The men are alleged to have planted a military-grade explosive device and attached a **steel clamp** to rail tracks in two incidents.

The explosive **went off** on Saturday night under a freight train, which suffered minor damage to its **undercarriage**.

“We are dealing with an act of sabotage, the consequence of which could have been – and here the **perpetrators**’ mistake also helped us – … a serious catastrophe with casualties.”

The prime minister said the recruitment of Ukrainian citizens by Russia served to “stir up possibly **radically** anti-Ukrainian sentiments”.

It is believed that Russia increasingly turned to this kind of “one-time” **operative**.

The Russian services also use the tactic in Ukraine, where teenagers have been recruited as **unwitting** suicide bombers.

However, the **nebulous** chain of command for such attacks and the difficulty of working out.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/us-and-russian-officials-draft-new-peace-plan-based-on-capitulation-from-ukraine

The two men have formed an important but unofficial **backchannel** between Moscow and Washington.

The Financial Times and Reuters reported that the proposal would require Ukraine to **halve** the size of its military.

“I heard a loud **rumble**.”

Zelenskyy, who met the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Wednesday in what he described as an effort to “**reinvigorate** negotiations” and secure a “just peace” for Ukraine.

“Every **brazen** attack against ordinary life shows that the pressure on Russia is insufficient,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.

Despite Kremlin claims that it is open to talks on ending the war, Moscow has shown no willingness to scale back its **far-reaching** demands.

Russia’s foreign ministry also said it was **unaware** of any new US peace proposal.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/20/ukraine-us-russian-peace-proposal-is-absurd-and-unacceptable

“Ukraine needs peace and Ukraine will do everything so that no one in the world can say we are **upending diplomacy**,” Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine would issue no “**rash**” statements.

There would also be a path to **reintegrating** Russia in the global economy, including the future lifting of sanctions.

American diplomats said Donald Trump was trying to achieve peace “with an **incredible sense** of momentum”.

Officials in Kyiv were **unimpressed**. They said the proposal was a “provocation”, the aim of which was to stir up division and “**disorientate**” Ukraine’s allies, they added.

Kellogg is regarded as being broadly **sympathetic** to Ukraine and has been consequently left out of direct US-Russian talks.

“It seems Dmitriev has **spun** this plan at a time when Zelenskyy is weak.”

US efforts to broker peace have hit **roadblocks** since Trump met Putin in Alaska in August.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/23/trump-ukraine-zero-gratitude-peace-plan-international-talks

In a **conciliatory** response, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was personally grateful to the US president.

Trump’s hostile rhetoric came after a confusing weekend in which Rubio, admitted the White House plan was **conceived** in Moscow, only to then insist the US was its author.

Having been **blind-sided** by Washington’s initiative, Ukraine’s European allies published their Kyiv-friendly plan on Sunday.

Amid a **backlash** from some Republican senators, Trump **rowed back** from his earlier demand that Zelenskyy sign off on the deal by Thursday.

European officials have been **scathing** about the US draft in private conversations. They say it undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and sets conditions for its EU **accession**.

Olexiy Haran, a professor of **comparative** politics at the Kyiv-Mohyla academy, said Ukrainians overwhelmingly rejected the Trump document and would support the European one.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/24/zelenskyy-trump-meeting-revised-us-peace-plan-ukraine-russia

Sergiy Kyslytsya told the Financial Times such issues had been “placed in **brackets**” for Trump and Zelenskyy to decide upon later.

EU leaders attending an EU-Africa summit in Angola welcomed a **degree** of progress, but said far more work remained to be done.

Europeans must be able to give their **consent** to “issues that affect European interests and sovereignty”.

Donald Tusk said the talks were **delicate** because “nobody wants to put off the Americans and President Trump from having the US on our side in this process”.

“The idea that the US is not engaging with both sides equally in this war to bring it to an end is a complete and total **fallacy**,” the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters.

With smoke rising from the rubble, one man was seen **crouched** and holding the hand of a dead person.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/25/nato-scrambles-jets-russian-drones-deepest-incursion-romania

German Typhoon and Romanian F-16 fighter jets took off in pairs to follow the **uncrewed** aircraft.

One of them, a **distinctive** **delta-wing** model with a Russian Z symbol spray painted on the **tailfin**, landed on a roof in the village.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/27/putin-insists-ukraine-surrender-territory-for-peace-deal-possible

Speaking to reporters during a working visit to **Kyrgyzstan**, Putin said Russia would halt its offensive only if Ukrainian forces withdrew from unspecified areas currently under Kyiv’s control.

Witkoff, a longtime Trump business **associate** and property developer, has faced criticism in Europe.

The Kremlin signals a willingness to explore potential peace deals, while showing no **inclination** to retreat from its maximalist demands – most of which are viewed in Kyiv as unacceptable and **tantamount** to capitulation.

They would require Ukraine to **voluntarily** cede territory that Moscow has failed to seize militarily.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/01/ukraine-war-briefing-trump-says-good-chance-of-deal-to-end-conflict-after-latest-talks-with-kyiv

“Ukraine’s got some difficult little problems,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, referring to a corruption investigation that recently forced President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to **sack** his chief of staff and top negotiator.

“We continue to be **realistic** about how difficult this is, but optimistic.”

A Ukrainian security source said Kyiv was responsible for attacks by **naval** drones on two oil tankers off Turkey’s Black Sea coast that it believed were covertly transporting sanctioned Russian oil. And the Ukrainian government has faced **turbulence**.

“Peace is within reach, if Vladimir Putin abandons his delusional hope of **reconstituting** the Soviet empire by first **subjugating** Ukraine,” he added.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/02/witkoff-in-moscow-for-talks-as-putin-claims-to-have-taken-key-ukrainian-city

“We discussed the **essence** of what is embedded in these American documents.”

“The president also did not hide our **critical** and even negative attitude towards a number of proposals.”

He added that the US hoped a compromise would allow them “not just to rebuild their economy, but to **prosper** as a country”.

The relatively **downbeat** assessments of Tuesday night’s diplomacy follows combative opening statements from Putin.

The US delegation was in an intense round of **shuttle** diplomacy that the Trump administration has claimed is its best chance yet of bringing an end to the war.

A short video **feed** from the Kremlin showed the two small delegations sitting on opposite sides of an oval white table.

He has also demanded clear, **enforceable** security guarantees from the west to prevent a future Russian invasion.

Putin’s comments appeared aimed at driving a **wedge** between Washington and European capitals.

**Buoyed** up by recent gains at the front, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy **faltered**.

The Russian president threatened that Moscow would “step up strikes on Ukrainian ports and on any ships entering them” in response to attacks on Russian tankers, which he described as “**piracy**”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/04/macron-believes-us-may-betray-ukraine-on-territory-says-der-spiegel

Der Spiegel said it had obtained an English summary of Monday’s call, featuring what it said were direct **quotations** from European heads of government in which they expressed fundamental doubts about Washington’s approach to the talks.

The magazine said other leaders also voiced their concerns, with Finland’s Alexander Stubb, who has **bonded with** Trump over golf.

Even the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte – who in public is very **complimentary** of Trump – reportedly said he agreed with Stubb “that we need to protect Volodymyr”.

Two of them reportedly said the remarks were “accurately **reproduced**”.

In a **guest column** for the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Merz argued for the use of frozen Russian state assets to support Ukraine.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/04/ukraine-war-briefing-stop-wasting-worlds-time-putin-told

The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the Russian president “should end the **bluster** and the bloodshed” and sit down to negotiate peace.

His latest remarks may **prick** the ears of Donald Trump, who, after once **haranguing** Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, drastically changed his tune, at least for a time, after Charles **indulged** the US president with a state visit and impressed upon him the broader importance of Ukraine’s defence.

Trump on Wednesday continued to loosely **preside over** attempts to strike a peace deal. Trump said Putin would like to make a deal but “what comes out of that meeting I can’t tell you because it does take two to **tango**”.

Ukraine’s military general staff announced recent strikes on Russian targets including a Black Sea observation post on an **oil rig**.

However a sanctions “**loophole**” has allowed Russian oil products refined elsewhere to find their way to Australia.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/07/kremlin-hails-trump-national-security-strategy-as-aligned-with-russia-vision

The Kremlin has **heaped** praise on Donald Trump’s latest national security strategy.

A White House document criticises the EU and says Europe is at risk of “civilisational **erasure**”.

“The adjustments that we see correspond in many ways to our **vision**,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Sunday.

A key issue for Kyiv is what security guarantees it would receive if it does agree to **renounce** control of some territory.

“Ukraine is determined to keep working **in good faith** with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.

Trump’s **outgoing** Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said at a defence forum on Saturday that the administration’s efforts to end the war were in “the last 10 metres”.

He said the US would not be “the idiot with the **chequebook**” any longer.

They say a difficult and potentially **bleak** winter lies ahead as Russia continues to target energy infrastructure.

It was the second **consecutive** night of attacks targeting energy.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is ready to hold a wartime election within the next three months, after Donald Trump accused him of **clinging on** to power.

Zelenskyy, clearly **irritated** by Trump’s intervention, said that “this is a question for the people of Ukraine, with all due respect to our partners”.

“**Moreover**, I am asking … the United States to help me, possibly together with European colleagues, to ensure security for the elections,” he added.

Trump made the comments in a **rambling** interview with **Politico** published earlier on Tuesday.

Trump’s son Donald Jr said that Zelenskyy was **prolonging** the war because he was worried he would otherwise lose power.

There would need to be elections or a referendum to **ratify** it, saying that only “the Ukrainian people” could make decisions on **territorial concessions**.

In Berlin, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, warned that the continent had been “quietly **complacent**” over the threat from Russia.

The US president appears to get **ever more** impatient with the lack of a peace deal.

Also on Thursday, top EU officials met in Lviv, in western Ukraine, to discuss Ukraine’s **accession** prospects, **even as** Hungary’s Russia-friendly leader, Viktor Orbán, continues to block formal negotiations.

“We all understand that the US president has various **levers** of influence, and these will work on those who are currently blocking Ukraine,” he said.

Nine members of the **regiment** died during the 120-day deployment that started in August.

He awarded the deceased state honours to “add **eternal** **lustre**” to their bravery.

Other images showed Kim **consoling** families of the deceased and kneeling before a portrait of a fallen soldier to pay his respects.

At a previous ceremony in August, images released by KCNA showed an emotional Kim embracing a returned solider who appeared **overwhelmed**, burying his face in the leader’s chest.

Under the proposal, Ukraine would have western support to maintain a **standing** army of 800,000 troops.

The deal would effectively provide “**article** five-like” guarantees to Ukraine.

They confirmed the US would not **put boots on the ground** in Ukraine as part of the deal.

Zelenskyy described the talks with the US side as “not easy” but said they had made **headway**.

The search for **viable** terms for an end to the war has run into major **obstacles**.

He also said he hoped Washington would accept freezing the frontline where it was, rather than Ukraine ceding the entire Donbas region, which **comprises** Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

The EU, meanwhile, is **scrambling** this week to agree a plan on financing Ukraine in the coming years by using frozen Russian assets. A leaders’ meeting is scheduled to begin on Thursday and a deal still appears **elusive**.
