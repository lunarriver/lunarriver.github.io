#### [2024-10-16 North Korean troops for Russia’s war in Ukraine: what we know so far](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/north-korean-troops-for-russias-war-in-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far)

North Korea, which has been **subject to** decades of UN-led sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, is **constantly** seeking new sources of foreign currency – and providing hardware to the Kremlin almost certainly comes with a **quid pro quo**.

The country’s already **fragile** economy was hit hard by the closure of its borders with China.

North Korean civilians reportedly sent to Ukraine to rebuild **shattered** infrastructure in Russian-held areas are another source of cash, in **defiance** of a UN order to **repatriate** all North Korean **migrant** workers by the end of 2019.

The conflict in Ukraine gives the regime the chance to **gauge** how well – or badly – its munitions and missiles perform in a real war setting.

#### [2024-10-18 North Korean troops have arrived in Russia to fight Ukraine, says Seoul](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/north-korean-troops-russia-arrived-ukraine-seoul)

This is a development that could intensify the **standoff** between North Korea and the west.

They **disguised** themselves as Russian soldiers.

A Kremlin spokesperson **dismissed** the claims at a media conference.

Pyongyang is estimated to have provided about half the larger-**calibre** ammunition used on the battlefield this year.

North Korea had shipped 1,500 special forces personnel to Russia’s far east for training and **acclimatising** at local military bases.

Seoul could consider providing defensive and **lethal** weapons to Ukraine.

We might also consider **offensive** use.

the presidential official was signalling Seoul’s most proactive position towards arming Ukraine **to date**.

The development **underscores** the potential for a divided Korean peninsula to become **entangled** in the conflict.

South Korea is home to some of the world’s largest **stockpiles** of artillery shells.

Putin finds it to **recruit** Russians to be cannon fodder

#### [2024-10-23 North Korean troops in Russia are ‘fair game’ if deployed to fight in Ukraine, US says](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/us-evidence-north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine)

The troops have now been **dispersed** to multiple training facilities in Russia.

After huge numbers of casualties on both sides in what has become a war of **attrition**.

North Korean authorities **thoroughly** crack down on the rumours.

#### [2024-10-24 Putin does not deny North Korea has sent soldiers to Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/putin-does-not-deny-north-korea-has-sent-soldiers-to-russia)

Vladimir Putin has **sidestepped** claims that North Korea has sent soldiers to Russia.

Putin may be being deliberately **ambiguous** to lower Ukraine morale.

No fellow Brics leader raised the issue in public during the summit, which instead heard **vague** calls for restraint.

Guterres rejected an invitation to attend a Ukrainian-**sponsored** peace summit this summer.

Putin stated that the emergence of a “more just world order” was being **hampered** by “forces accustomed to thinking and acting in the logic of domination over everything and everyone”. He said Kyiv’s foreign backers did not any longer even hide their goal of **inflicting** a strategic defeat on his country.

They don’t take into account the unity and the strength of spirit of Russians **forged** over the centuries.

#### [2024-10-29 Russia to deploy 10,000 North Korean troops against Ukraine within ‘weeks’, Pentagon says](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/russia-north-korean-troops-ukraine-war)

North Korean state media said on Tuesday a **delegation** had left Pyongyang for an official visit to Russia, without elaborating.

It will pile more pressure on Ukraine’s **weary** and **overstretched** army.

It will also **stoke** geopolitical tensions in the Korean Peninsula.

Vladimir Putin is keen to reshape global power **dynamics**.

He sought to build a **counterbalance** to western influence.

They are **cobelligerents** in the war.

Sergei Lavrov **shrugged off** Rutte’s comments.

Lavrov claimed that western military instructors have long been **covertly** deployed to Ukraine.

Ukraine could get more **bleak** news from next week’s US presidential election. A Donald Trump victory could see key US military help **dwindle**.

Russian troops have captured the Donetsk village of Tsukuryne – the latest settlement to **succumb** to the slow-moving Russian **onslaught**.

Rutte briefed the alliance’s 32 national ambassadors at Nato **headquarters**.

#### [2024-10-29 North and South Korea relations: what’s behind the tensions – in 30 seconds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/north-and-south-korea-tensions-relations-issue-conflict-division-explained-in-30-seconds)

The South, a US ally, was **proclaimed** a republic the same year.

The opening **salvo** in what would become a bloody three-year conflict.

The war ended in 1953 in an uneasy **truce**, but not a peace treaty.

The border is often the **focal** point for tensions between the neighbours, including the North’s recent **demolition** of roads leading to the South.

Relations between the neighbours have alternated between engagement and **estrangement**.

The North sent thousands of troops to help Russia in its war against Ukraine, in addition to large **quantities** of ammunition. And there has been a new round of cross-border **friction** in the form of the “balloon wars”.

#### [2024-10-30 North Korean troops fighting for Russia in Ukraine will ‘surely return in body bags’, US envoy says](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/north-korea-troops-russia-kursk-ukraine-lloyd-austin)

The US envoy **bluntly** warned that Pyongyang’s forces entering Ukraine “will surely return in body bags”.

Russia and North Korea have deepened their political and military alliance as the Ukraine war has **dragged on**.

Pyongyang will ask for technology transfers from Russia to aid its weapons programs, including **reconnaissance** satellites.

The official was not authorised to **disclose** the information publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Moscow’s UN envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, said on Wednesday that Pyongyang’s forces were not present on the frontlines, deeming any suggestion to the contrary as “**barefaced** lies” and accusing Washington and London of “**disinformation**”.

#### [2024-10-31 North Korea missile test reaches record height and duration, says Japan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/north-korea-missile-test-record-height-icbm-japan)

North Korea has test launched a long-range missile **theoretically** capable of striking the US mainland.

South Korea’s government announced new export controls on materials needed to produce solid-fuel missiles – which are **superior** to those that use liquid fuel.

North Korea struggles to produce on its own, including **fuselages** and **combustion** tubes.

The North deliberately launches long-range missiles at a **steep** **trajectory** to avoid neighbouring countries.

Missiles with built-in solid **propellants** are easier to move and hide, and can be launched quicker than liquid-propellant weapons.

Experts believe North Korea **possesses** short-range nuclear missiles that can strike South Korea, but are **sceptical** of Pyongyang’s claims that it is able to strike more distant targets using missiles tipped with **miniaturised** nuclear warheads.

#### [2024-11-02 Volodymyr Zelenskyy urges allies to stop just ‘watching’ amid North Korea threat](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/02/volodymyr-zelenskyy-urges-allies-to-stop-just-watching-amid-north-korea-threat)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the prospect of a **pre-emptive** Ukrainian strike on camps where the North Korean troops are being trained.

Western leaders have described the North Korean troop deployment as a significant escalation that could also **jolt** relations in the Indo-Pacific region.

Moscow has **consistently** signalled that it would view any such strikes as a significant escalation.

Ukraine’s top commander said on Saturday that his troops were struggling to **stem** “one of the most powerful offensives” by Russia.

Russia has for months been conducting a ferocious campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually **compelling** Kyiv to surrender ground.

In Kyiv, air raid sirens **wailed** for more than five hours early Saturday morning as Russian drones hit the capital.

#### [2024-11-04 North Korea tells UN it is speeding up nuclear weapons programme](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/04/north-korea-tells-un-it-is-speeding-up-nuclear-weapons-programme)

Japan’s coast guard said the **projectile** was believed to be a ballistic missile.

That meants to demonstrate North Korea’s growing **prowess** at developing missiles

The potential situation is approaching the **brink** of war.

Pyongyang had been “**emboldened** to continue advancing its unlawful ballistic missile, nuclear and WMD programmes.

Russia and China have shamelessly protected Pyongyang from any reprisal.

The US and South Korea announced a new **memorandum** of understanding to develop cooperation on civil nuclear energy.
