#### [2024-10-16 North Korean troops for Russia’s war in Ukraine: what we know so far](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/north-korean-troops-for-russias-war-in-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far)

North Korea, which has been **subject to** decades of UN-led sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, is **constantly** seeking new sources of foreign currency – and providing hardware to the Kremlin almost certainly comes with a **quid pro quo**.

The country’s already **fragile** economy was hit hard by the closure of its borders with China.

North Korean civilians reportedly sent to Ukraine to rebuild **shattered** infrastructure in Russian-held areas are another source of cash, in **defiance** of a UN order to **repatriate** all North Korean **migrant** workers by the end of 2019.

The conflict in Ukraine gives the regime the chance to **gauge** how well – or badly – its munitions and missiles perform in a real war setting.

#### [2024-10-18 North Korean troops have arrived in Russia to fight Ukraine, says Seoul](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/north-korean-troops-russia-arrived-ukraine-seoul)

This is a development that could intensify the **standoff** between North Korea and the west.

They **disguised** themselves as Russian soldiers.

A Kremlin spokesperson **dismissed** the claims at a media conference.

Pyongyang is estimated to have provided about half the larger-**calibre** ammunition used on the battlefield this year.

#### [2024-10-22 South Korea mulls aiding Ukraine amid reports North Korea to assist Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/22/south-korea-mulls-aiding-ukraine-evidence-north-korea-involvement-war)

North Korea had shipped 1,500 special forces personnel to Russia’s far east for training and **acclimatising** at local military bases.

Seoul could consider providing defensive and **lethal** weapons to Ukraine.

We might also consider **offensive** use.

the presidential official was signalling Seoul’s most proactive position towards arming Ukraine **to date**.

The development **underscores** the potential for a divided Korean peninsula to become **entangled** in the conflict.

South Korea is home to some of the world’s largest **stockpiles** of artillery shells.

Putin finds it to **recruit** Russians to be cannon fodder

#### [2024-10-23 North Korean troops in Russia are ‘fair game’ if deployed to fight in Ukraine, US says](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/us-evidence-north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine)

The troops have now been **dispersed** to multiple training facilities in Russia.

After huge numbers of casualties on both sides in what has become a war of **attrition**.

North Korean authorities **thoroughly** crack down on the rumours.

#### [2024-10-24 Putin does not deny North Korea has sent soldiers to Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/putin-does-not-deny-north-korea-has-sent-soldiers-to-russia)

Vladimir Putin has **sidestepped** claims that North Korea has sent soldiers to Russia.

Putin may be being deliberately **ambiguous** to lower Ukraine morale.

No fellow Brics leader raised the issue in public during the summit, which instead heard **vague** calls for restraint.

Guterres rejected an invitation to attend a Ukrainian-**sponsored** peace summit this summer.

Putin stated that the emergence of a “more just world order” was being **hampered** by “forces accustomed to thinking and acting in the logic of domination over everything and everyone”. He said Kyiv’s foreign backers did not any longer even hide their goal of **inflicting** a strategic defeat on his country.

They don’t take into account the unity and the strength of spirit of Russians **forged** over the centuries.

#### [2024-10-29 Russia to deploy 10,000 North Korean troops against Ukraine within ‘weeks’, Pentagon says](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/russia-north-korean-troops-ukraine-war)

North Korean state media said on Tuesday a **delegation** had left Pyongyang for an official visit to Russia, without elaborating.

It will pile more pressure on Ukraine’s **weary** and **overstretched** army.

It will also **stoke** geopolitical tensions in the Korean Peninsula.

Vladimir Putin is keen to reshape global power **dynamics**.

He sought to build a **counterbalance** to western influence.

They are **cobelligerents** in the war.

Sergei Lavrov **shrugged off** Rutte’s comments.

Lavrov claimed that western military instructors have long been **covertly** deployed to Ukraine.

Ukraine could get more **bleak** news from next week’s US presidential election. A Donald Trump victory could see key US military help **dwindle**.

Russian troops have captured the Donetsk village of Tsukuryne – the latest settlement to **succumb** to the slow-moving Russian **onslaught**.

Rutte briefed the alliance’s 32 national ambassadors at Nato **headquarters**.

#### [2024-10-29 North and South Korea relations: what’s behind the tensions – in 30 seconds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/north-and-south-korea-tensions-relations-issue-conflict-division-explained-in-30-seconds)

The South, a US ally, was **proclaimed** a republic the same year.

The opening **salvo** in what would become a bloody three-year conflict.

The war ended in 1953 in an uneasy **truce**, but not a peace treaty.

The border is often the **focal** point for tensions between the neighbours, including the North’s recent **demolition** of roads leading to the South.

Relations between the neighbours have alternated between engagement and **estrangement**.

The North sent thousands of troops to help Russia in its war against Ukraine, in addition to large **quantities** of ammunition. And there has been a new round of cross-border **friction** in the form of the “balloon wars”.

#### [2024-10-30 North Korean troops fighting for Russia in Ukraine will ‘surely return in body bags’, US envoy says](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/north-korea-troops-russia-kursk-ukraine-lloyd-austin)

The US envoy **bluntly** warned that Pyongyang’s forces entering Ukraine “will surely return in body bags”.

Russia and North Korea have deepened their political and military alliance as the Ukraine war has **dragged on**.

Pyongyang will ask for technology transfers from Russia to aid its weapons programs, including **reconnaissance** satellites.

The official was not authorised to **disclose** the information publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Moscow’s UN envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, said on Wednesday that Pyongyang’s forces were not present on the frontlines, deeming any suggestion to the contrary as “**barefaced** lies” and accusing Washington and London of “**disinformation**”.

#### [2024-10-31 North Korea missile test reaches record height and duration, says Japan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/north-korea-missile-test-record-height-icbm-japan)

North Korea has test launched a long-range missile **theoretically** capable of striking the US mainland.

South Korea’s government announced new export controls on materials needed to produce solid-fuel missiles – which are **superior** to those that use liquid fuel.

North Korea struggles to produce on its own, including **fuselages** and **combustion** tubes.

The North deliberately launches long-range missiles at a **steep** **trajectory** to avoid neighbouring countries.

Missiles with built-in solid **propellants** are easier to move and hide, and can be launched quicker than liquid-propellant weapons.

Experts believe North Korea **possesses** short-range nuclear missiles that can strike South Korea, but are **sceptical** of Pyongyang’s claims that it is able to strike more distant targets using missiles tipped with **miniaturised** nuclear warheads.

#### [2024-11-02 Volodymyr Zelenskyy urges allies to stop just ‘watching’ amid North Korea threat](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/02/volodymyr-zelenskyy-urges-allies-to-stop-just-watching-amid-north-korea-threat)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the prospect of a **pre-emptive** Ukrainian strike on camps where the North Korean troops are being trained.

Western leaders have described the North Korean troop deployment as a significant escalation that could also **jolt** relations in the Indo-Pacific region.

Moscow has **consistently** signalled that it would view any such strikes as a significant escalation.

Ukraine’s top commander said on Saturday that his troops were struggling to **stem** “one of the most powerful offensives” by Russia.

Russia has for months been conducting a ferocious campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually **compelling** Kyiv to surrender ground.

In Kyiv, air raid sirens **wailed** for more than five hours early Saturday morning as Russian drones hit the capital.

#### [2024-11-04 North Korea tells UN it is speeding up nuclear weapons programme](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/04/north-korea-tells-un-it-is-speeding-up-nuclear-weapons-programme)

Japan’s coast guard said the **projectile** was believed to be a ballistic missile.

That meants to demonstrate North Korea’s growing **prowess** at developing missiles

The potential situation is approaching the **brink** of war.

Pyongyang had been “**emboldened** to continue advancing its unlawful ballistic missile, nuclear and WMD programmes.

Russia and China have shamelessly protected Pyongyang from any reprisal.

The US and South Korea announced a new **memorandum** of understanding to develop cooperation on civil nuclear energy.

#### [2024-11-05 Inexperienced, poorly trained and underfed: the North Korean troops heading to Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine-war-kim-jong-un-putin)

Depending on whom you ask, they are the boost that Russian forces need to make a significant **breakthrough** in Ukraine, or they are simple cannon fodder

The Kremlin’s forces have struggled to **repel** a Ukrainian incursion.

Russia had been training them to use artillery, drones and “basic infantry operations, including **trench** clearing, indicating that they fully intend to use these forces in frontline operations”.

But not one of the young men **drafted** from Kim Jong-un’s regular army has seen combat.

Experts believe the military **dividends** for the Kremlin will be limited.

Russia appears to have armed more than 7,000 North Korean soldiers positioned near the border with Ukraine with 60mm **mortars**, AK-12 rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, anti-tank guided missiles and anti-tank **grenade** launchers.

A North Korean soldier was found by the South Korean doctors who saved him to have a 27cm **intestinal** worm and a host of other **parasites** in his system.

South Korean researchers in 2015 cited elevated rates of **chronic** **hepatitis** B and C, **tuberculosis** and parasites among North Korean **defectors**.

The **transplanted** troops could benefit from their time on the Ukrainian front.

“Kim Jong-un is taking a big gamble,” said a former North Korean army first **lieutenant**.

The coming weeks will tell if the North Korean troops are more than poorly prepared, **unwitting** **mercenaries** Kim has offered up to enrich and strengthen his regime.

#### [2024-11-06 North Korea’s involvement in Ukraine draws China into a delicate balancing act](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine-war-china-relationship)

North Korea’s entry to the **theatre** draws Asia closer into the European conflict, risking a dangerous expansion and escalation of a war that has global ramifications.

China wants to maintain stability in the region as the Asian power and keep the US and allies **at bay**, all while grappling with a **spluttering** economy at home.

But how much Beijing can use its **sway** over Pyongyang to actually move the needle isn’t clear.

The arrangement between Russia and North Korea risked establishing a bloc, inevitably including China, which would be **pitted** against a US-South Korea-Japan alliance.

China should be “highly **vigilant**” about the situation.

China cannot ignore the historical lesson that gradual changes can lead to a **qualitative** shift.

It would pose a severe challenge to the international **nonproliferation** regime, in which China has a significant stake.

China today **envisions** a strategic coalition with Russia and North Korea, but with itself in the driver’s seat, wary of either partner taking **radical** **initiatives** beyond its control.

China doesn’t want a more powerful North Korea **upsetting** the balance of peace in east Asia, and it worries that a Russian victory in Ukraine would make Nato more **cohesive**.

These developments could quickly **derail** Beijing’s **quest**.

#### [2024-11-08 ‘They will just die uselessly’: Ukrainians ready for North Korean troops joining Russia’s war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/ukrainians-ready-for-north-korean-troops-russia-war)

He has been **mugging up** with the help of a three-page printed guide. It lists words in Ukrainian, their Korean equivalent, and a helpful **transliteration**.

Moscow carries out **assaults** using small infantry groups.

North Korea has **pledged** to support Moscow until it achieves a “great victory” in Ukraine.

They might be **fanatical** professionals with totalitarian souls.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hinted that Ukraine’s Kursk **salient** could play a role in negotiations after Donald Trump’s return to the White House.

They could wipe out North Korean troops **mustering** in western Russia.

He said the surprise offensive had **punctured** the myth of Russian **invincibility**, especially in the eyes of international partners, and raised morale.

In terms of size we are an **expeditionary** corps.

On 22 October his brigade had captured four Russian soldiers, 12 days after they were first **conscripted**.

A group of newly mobilised Ukrainian service personnel smoked next to their **pickup** transport.

His **squad** piled on to the vehicle’s **rear** **cargo** bed, clutching sleeping **mats** and box of chocolate biscuits.

It’s a **rodeo** with all types of weapons.

In reality, we will hand North Koreans over to the **competent** organs.

He said locals he talked to used **derogatory** words to describe people from Chechnya, and pointed out neighbours who had **fraternised** with them.

There is incredible **racism** here.

#### [2024-11-21 Putin sends African lion, brown bears and cockatoos to North Korea as gift of support](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/putin-north-korea-animals-gift-african-lion-brown-bears-cockatoos-ukraine-war)

The delivery also included two domestic **yaks**, 40 mandarin ducks and five white **cockatoos**.

The two also took turns driving each other around in a Russian-built Aurus **limousine**.

The pact has **magnified** western concerns about potential Russian aid for North Korea’s missile or nuclear programmes.

#### [2024-12-18 The Guardian view on North Koreans dying for Russia: an alarming alliance gains strength](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/18/the-guardian-view-on-north-koreans-dying-for-russia-an-alarming-alliance-gains-strength)

Those sent, however, are thought to include elite troops trained in **infiltration**, sabotage and assassination missions.

And given the desperate poverty, any financial **compensation** and status improvement could transform the lives of those **bereaved**.

The wages for those still fighting will almost all be claimed by the regime, which is also welcoming **sorely** needed oil and grain supplies.

China will not be **thrilled**. It already has a tense relationship with the country it has long propped up. Now Vladimir Putin has handed North Korea increased **bargaining** power with its **patron**.

Another concern for North Korea, however, should perhaps be that thousands of its fighters see a way of life that – even in Kursk, or **devastated** areas of Ukraine – may look **startlingly** comfortable compared with dire conditions back home.

Ukrainian sources have claimed that some North Koreans have already **deserted**. Special forces will enjoy better-than-average conditions and will have been **vetted** for political reliability.

#### [2024-12-23 More than 1,000 North Korean military casualties in Ukraine war, says South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/23/north-korean-soldiers-killed-wounded-ukraine-war-south-korea)

The JCS did not say how many troops had been **killed in action**, but the claims underline the risks posed to the North’s untested armed forces, amid reports that the regime is **poised** to send furtthe high number of casualties could be **attributed** to the “unfamiliar battlefield environmenther reinforcements to Ukraine.

The statement said North Korea was also “producing and providing self-destructing drones”, along with rocket launchers and self-**propelled** artillery.

The North Korean leader wants access to Russian rocket technology and other military **knowhow** in exchange for providing its forces with ammunition, weapons and reinforcements.

Pyongyang has also sent more than 10,000 containers of artillery rounds, anti-tank rockets, as well as mechanised **howitzers** and rocket launchers.

A foreign ministry spokesperson said the foreign ministers of 10 countries and the EU were “**distorting** and **slandering**” Pyongyang’s “normal cooperative” ties with Moscow, according to state media.

#### [2024-12-27 Injured North Korean soldier captured by Ukraine has died, says South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/27/north-korean-soldier-captured-ukraine-injured-south-korea)

A photo of the soldier, who looked **gaunt** and appeared to have been injured.

The soldier would be the first North Korean **combatant** to have been taken by Ukrainian forces.

Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as **expendable** and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defences.

That **prospect** has raised concerns in Kyiv that a settlement could be imposed on terms favourable to Moscow, as Ukraine struggles on the battlefield.

#### [2025-01-08 North Korea learning from fighting with Russia against Ukraine, US warns](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/north-korea-learning-from-fighting-with-russia-against-ukraine-us-warns)

North Korea is benefiting from its troops fighting alongside Russia against Ukraine, gaining experience that makes Pyongyang “more capable of **waging** war against its neighbours” a senior US official has warned.

In turn, the DPRK will likely be eager to **leverage** these improvements to promote weapons sales and military training contracts globally.

United States **embellished** Israel’s **nefarious** mass killing **atrocity** as the right to self-defence.

He also rejected as “wholly **unsubstantiated**” a US allegation that Russia intends to share satellite and space technology with Pyongyang.

Such statements are the latest example of baseless **conjecture** which is geared towards **smearing** bilateral cooperation between the Russian Federation and the friendly nation of the DPRK

#### [2025-01-12 Ukraine’s capture of North Koreans offers rare insight into Russian alliance, says Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/ukraines-capture-of-north-koreans-offers-rare-insight-into-russian-alliance-says-zelenskyy)

He praised the paratroopers and tactical group that **retrieved** them.

They represent a PR opportunity for Kyiv, during a **precarious** moment for Ukraine as Donald Trump returns to the White House.

Ukraine is fighting an unprecedented **coalition** of **malign** autocratic states.

The SBU released video footage and photographs showing the two North Korean men in hospital **bunks**.

The other wrote his answers due to his injured jaw, stating that he was born in 1999, had joined the army in 2016 and was a **scout** sniper.

Kyiv has rejected any deal that forces it to **cede** territory to Russia.

He said it was necessary to “find a way out of this war, without a **dictated** peace in which the Ukrainians have no say”.

Early on Sunday, a Russian oil tanker was **manoeuvred** safely into the port of Sassnitz by tug boats.

The tanker is believed to be part of an extensive operation by Moscow to try to circumnavigate sanctions, for which **dilapidated**, unseaworthy ships are often used.

The 274-metre-long vessel with 24 crew members has effectively been **impounded** by authorities until a decision is made as to how to deal with it.

We must **adhere** to the three principles of ‘no spillover from the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no adding oil to the fire by relevant parties’, so as to ease the situation as soon as possible.

Ukrainian authorities have announced the **mandatory** evacuation of children and their families from Borova in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv.

We will provide $20bn in loans to Ukraine that will be paid back by the interest earned from **immobilised** Russian sovereign assets.

Russia will not **prevail** in this conflict … **tyrants** will be responsible for the damages they cause.

The US plans to **disperse** $10bn by December as economic aid.

Romania **scrambled** two F-16 fighter jets after detecting what were probably two drones **breaching** its national airspace.

Responsibility for previous incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Bryansk regions has been claimed by two **murky** groups: the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion.

Putin said that it was too early to say exactly how Russia would react to such a move but that Moscow would have to respond **accordingly** and different options were being examined.

Nato countries have all been **staunch** supporters of Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion.

Ukrainian drones targeted an **ethanol** plant in Russia’s Voronezh region.

It is through the policy of non-**alignment** that South Africa has been able to **constructively** engage with both Russia and Ukraine.

#### [2024-10-29 Ukraine war briefing: Bomb shatters historic landmark in Kharkiv](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/ukraine-war-briefing-bomb-derzhprom-historic-landmark-kharkiv)

A Russian guided bomb attack on Kharkiv on Monday **shattered** much of the Derzhprom building.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, **deplored** the attack on his home town, as well as on Kharkiv, and called for renewed efforts to force Vladimir Putin to halt the war.

In the southern Kherson region, a drone attack killed a **medic** on Monday.

They ought to be concerned about this **destabilising** action by two of its neighbours, Russia and North Korea.

It added that the value of the older eastern European-made tanks and equipment would be **deducted** from the total price for the new Leopard 2A8 tanks that Croatia will buy.

#### [2024-11-02 Ukraine war briefing: North Korea says it will back Russia until it achieves victory](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/02/ukraine-war-briefing-north-korea-says-it-will-back-russia-until-it-achieves-victory)

She said Pyongyang had no doubt that under Putin’s “wise leadership” Russia will “achieve a great victory in their **sacred** struggle to protect the sovereign rights and security interests”.

The Ukrainian president called on Ukraine’s allies to stop “watching” and take action to tackle the presence of North Korean troops in Russia before they start **confronting** his country in combat.

The package, which will be drawn from US stocks, also includes air-to-ground munitions, medical equipment, **demolition** munitions and spare parts.

Another 14 drones were “locationally lost” and one out of three **cruise** missiles launched was also destroyed, it said.

The main problem we have now are **powders** and explosives.

Ukraine, he said, was now producing its own artillery shells, including the **coveted** 155mm calibre used by heavy artillery pieces donated to Ukraine by allied Nato countries.

#### [2024-11-17 Ukraine war briefing: Biden urges Xi to dissuade North Korea from deepening Russian support](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/17/ukraine-war-briefing-biden-urges-xi-to-dissuade-north-korea-from-deepening-russian-support)

The introduction of DPRK troops runs **foursquare** against that.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy **endorsed** a rapid push to broker a deal on Saturday.

February 2025 would mark the third anniversary of Moscow’s invasion, with Russia’s troops gaining ground in recent months against Kyiv’s outmanned and **outgunned** soldiers.

Russia remained the **sole** **obstacle** to a just peace in Ukraine.

Moscow’s forces are **bearing down** on Kurakhove, which has a thermal power plant and is 7 km from Pokrovsk, a large town which for much of the war has been one of Ukraine’s logistical **linchpin**.
