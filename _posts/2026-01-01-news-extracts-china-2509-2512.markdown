#### [China’s ‘temple economy’ in the spotlight as scandals rock influential religious leaders | China | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/chinas-temple-economy-in-the-spotlight-as-scandals-rock-influential-religious-leaders)

For a religious leader, the allegations were scandalous. Mistresses, **illegitimate** children, embezzlement. But in 2015, the head **abbott** of Shaolin monastery, the **cradle** of **Zen Buddhism** and kung-fu in China, was untouchable.

The Shaolin Temple released a statement saying that he was being investigated for allegedly **misappropriating** funds and for fathering illegitimate children with multiple mistresses.

```
illegitimate ~ adjective ~ born of parents not married to each other

abbot ~ noun ~ a man who is in charge of a monastery

cradle ~ noun ~ a small bed for a baby, especially one that moves from side to side

misappropriate ~ verb ~ to steal something that you have been trusted to take care of and use it for your own good
```

The controversies reveal the increasingly **precarious** position of influential religious leaders in China, as the official support for the commercialisation of religious sites gives way to an emphasis on **frugality** and political **obedience**.

Wu is accused of **soliciting** public donations under the guise of collecting money for unmarried pregnant women and needy children, which was actually spent on personal **extravagances**.

```
precarious ~ adjective ~ in a dangerous state because of not being safe or not being held in place firmly

frugality ~ noun ~ the quality of being careful when using money or food

obedience ~ noun ~ the fact that people or animals do what they are told to do

solicit ~ verb ~ to ask someone for money, information, or help

extravagance ~ noun ~ behaviour in which you spend more money than you need to
```

In August, a video of monks from Hangzhou’s Lingyin Temple sitting around a table counting **wads** of cash went viral, catapulting the 4th century hall of **worship** into a social media storm.

In **medieval** times, monasteries stood in for banks, loaning cash to **merchants** while charging high interest rates.

The **opprobrium** comes from ordinary people who see riches as being spiritually **corrosive**, and, increasingly, from the government, which under the leadership of Xi Jinping has cracked down on excess wealth and corruption.

```
wad ~ noun ~ a number of usually flat and/or small objects pressed tightly together

worship ~ noun ~ the act of worshipping God or a god, often through praying or singing

medieval ~ adjective ~ related to the Middle Ages (= the period in European history from about AD 600 to AD 1500)

merchant ~ noun ~ a person whose job is to buy and sell products in large amounts, especially by trading with other countries

opprobrium ~ noun ~ severe criticism and blame

corrosive ~ adjective ~ A corrosive substance causes damage by chemical action.
```

But as China entered a period of economic reform and opening up in the 1980s, temples were back in **vogue**, with many turning to tourism to support themselves, often with explicit government support.

Gift shops selling Shaolin-branded **merchandise** also opened, and Shaolin **Inc** was born.

Over the years he took a **troupe** of **martial** arts monks to Moscow for a special performance at the invitation of Vladimir Putin. It led one worker near the Shaolin monastery to remark that the political **heft** of local CCP officials seemed **paltry** in comparison with Shi.

```
vogue ~ noun ~ a fashion or general liking, especially one that is temporary

merchandise ~ noun ~ goods that are bought and sold

troupe ~ noun ~ a group of performers such as singers or dancers who work and travel together

martial ~ adjective ~ relating to soldiers, war, or life in the armed forces

heft ~ noun ~ the weight of something

paltry ~ adjective ~ (of an amount of money) very small and of little or no value
```

As China suffers with **stubbornly** sluggish economic growth, temples in theory are a gift to both local governments and ordinary people. The authorities benefit from increased domestic spending as people flock to temple-**cum**-tourist attractions, while people struggling to find work or fulfilment in Chinese society are increasingly turning to religion for spiritual guidance.

But temples also must **tread** an increasingly narrow line between popularity and political obedience.

“It’s almost always that there is something else going on that has to do with **patronage**,” says Ian Johnson, the author of The Souls of China, a book about religion in China.

Xi has shown a particular interest in traditional Chinese religions. Early in his career he helped to re-open important Buddhist temples and turn them into tourist attractions, a blueprint for how the officially **atheist** Party could work with religion.

```
stubbornly ~ adverb ~ in a way that shows you are determined to do what you want and refuse to do anything else

cum ~ prep ~ used for linking two nouns

tread ~ verb ~ to put your foot on something or to press something down with your foot

patronage ~ noun ~ the support given to an organization by someone

atheist ~ noun ~ someone who does not believe in any god or gods, or who believes that no god or gods exist
```

Now it seems that the Shaolin monastery, set in the **jagged** Song mountain range, is being brought to heel. He **halted** commercial performances, banned expensive **consecration** rituals, said he would remove temple shops and said that he would eliminate other unpopular fees.

But so far, the anti-commercialisation drive is **patchy** at best. Yellow-robed monks stage daily, **spellbinding** martial arts that are free – for anyone who has bought an 80 yuan ticket to the temple complex.

It would not have been known internationally … there are **pros and cons**.

“After all, I’d also want to drive a range **rover**”.

```
jagged ~ adjective ~ rough and with sharp points

halt ~ verb ~ to (cause to) stop moving or doing something or happening

consecration ~ noun ~ the act or process of officially making something holy and able to be used for religious ceremonies

patchy ~ adjective ~ only existing or happening in some parts

spellbinding ~ adjective ~ holding your attention completely

rover ~ noun ~ a person who spends their time travelling from place to place
```

#### [UN and rights groups condemn reported jailing of Wuhan Covid citizen journalist | China | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/22/un-rights-groups-condemn-reported-jailing-wuhan-covid-citizen-journalist-zhang-zhan)

She was one of a number of independent journalists to be detained for broadcasting reports about the severe **lockdown** at **ground zero** of the pandemic.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said reports of Zhang’s rearrest and sentencing were “deeply **disturbing**”.

He said: “This is the second time Zhang has been convicted and subjected to a **custodial** sentence for this offence.”

In August 2024, she was detained and later charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, with her **indictment** citing posts on social media that “seriously damaged the country’s image”

During Zhang’s first **spell** in prison she went on hunger strike and there were reports of her being force-fed.

```
lockdown ~ noun ~ an emergency situation in which people are not allowed to freely enter, leave, or move around in a building or area because of danger

ground zero ~ noun ~ the exact place where a nuclear bomb explodes

disturbing ~ adjective ~ making you feel worried or upset

custodial ~ adjective ~ relating to the legal right to care for someone or something, especially a child

indictment ~ noun ~ a formal statement of accusing someone of something

spell ~ noun ~ a period of time for which an activity or condition lasts continuously
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/xi-directs-quashing-of-chinese-feminists-even-as-he-praises-advances-at-womens-conference

In the past 30 years, women were now participating in the project of national governance with “unprecedented confidence and **vigour**”.

The leader has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society and led a **patriarchal** turn in politics. In 2022 he unveiled a new **politburo**, which for the first time since 1997 included no women.

The government routinely **exhorts** women to fulfil what it says are traditional responsibilities of marriage and child-bearing.

It came a few weeks after more than 1,300 accounts on Weibo were given temporary or permanent bans for inciting “gender **antagonism**”.

In June, the platform launched a **dedicated** **complaints** category for reporting content that “promotes gender antagonism”.

Wang Huiling, a vlogger from rural Anhui province, shot to **fame** during the Covid-19 pandemic. Her experience of coming from a village, where social norms are more conservative, stood in contrast to the more middle-class feminist **discourse** from China’s cities.

But Wang’s **precise** reach in China is now hard to gauge because, in January, all of her social media accounts were deleted without explanation.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/11/china-removes-gay-dating-apps-blued-finka-apple-android-lgbt-rights

**As of** Tuesday, Blued and Finka were unavailable on Apple’s app store and several Android platforms.

“Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China **storefront** only.”

**Homosexuality** is legal in China.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/new-hongqi-bridge-in-south-west-china-collapses-into-mountainside

A newly opened bridge in south-west China collapsed on Tuesday, sending **slabs of concrete** and **plumes of dust** into the **mountainside** and water below.

The bridge was part of a national highway linking Sichuan and Tibet, which runs through a **seismically** active part of China.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/beijing-court-appeal-jailed-chinese-journalist-dong-yuyu-human-rights

The detention of Dong has been criticised by international human rights and **press freedom** organisations.

He won a prestigious Nieman **fellowship** at Harvard University in 2006.

The Nieman Foundation has described Dong as a “**cherished** member” of the international Nieman community.

Dong’s **indictment** mentioned several senior Japanese diplomats who do not appear to have been expelled from China despite being involved with Dong’s alleged **espionage ring**.

“It’s pretty obvious there is no legal **argument** to uphold the verdict.”

His **incarceration** shows that China’s reform era is really over.”

In 2017, he was threatened with a **demotion** after a Chinese Communist party investigation deemed his writing “anti-socialist”.

Beh Lih Yi said Dong’s imprisonment “creates a **chilling** effect designed to stop or prevent any Chinese from speaking with foreigners.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/25/protests-erupt-in-chinas-guizhou-province-over-cremation-mandate

The local area has a high **proportion** of people of the Miao ethnicity.

It said that cremation was necessary to preserve land resources and promote a “**frugal** new funeral style”.

In recent years China has struggled with crowded **cemeteries**.

The initial trigger can be the state’s **intrusion** into what many people see as a deeply personal matter.

People are much more likely to feel **motivated** to take the risk of protest.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/28/china-civil-service-exam-age-limit-changed

A record number of people are set to take China’s notoriously **gruelling** national civil service exam this weekend.

Some jobs are particularly **in demand**.

China’s ageing population and **dwindling** pension budget has forced a reckoning with its relatively low retirement ages. The **statutory** retirement age for women will increase from 50 to 55 for those in **blue-collar** jobs.

In recent years some **debt-ridden** local authorities have struggled to pay wages at all. **Harking** back to the Maoist era, civil services jobs are known as providing the “iron rice bowl”.

“The **occupational** structure of China’s job market has shifted markedly over the last decade. In the latter, formal **contractual** obligations are weak,” said George Magnus.

In 2023 the government temporarily stopped publishing youth unemployment figures, which had reached a record 21.3%, resuming publication after a few months with a new **methodology** that excludes students.

And next year, China is **bracing itself for** a record 12.7 million graduates.

The raising of the age limit for the exams has generally been welcomed, especially as it could help workers avoid the **well-documented** “curse of 35”.

Questions from last year covered Xi Jinping’s major speeches of the past 12 months and Communist party **plenums**.

It involved pre-dawn starts and **cramming** in study sessions around **childcare**, with the result being four to five hours of sleep a night.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/14/hong-kong-opposition-democratic-party-disbands-chinese-pressure

Hong Kong’s last major opposition party has disbanded after a vote by its members, the **culmination** of Chinese pressure on the city’s remaining liberal voices in a years-long security crackdown.

However, mass pro-democracy protests in 2019 against a perceived tightening of China’s grip on the city prompted Beijing to enact a sweeping national security law to **stifle** dissent.

On Sunday, DP members voted to disband the party and to enter **liquidation**,.

Of 121 votes cast, 117 were in favour of disbanding while four were **abstentions**.

Senior party members previously told Reuters they had been **approached** by Chinese officials or “middlemen” and told to disband or face severe consequences, including possible arrest.

There was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Hong Kong **Liaison** Office, China’s main representative body in the special administrative region.

“I find it very **problematic**,” she said.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/15/china-uyghur-human-rights-ice

Guan “would likely be **persecuted**” if he returned to China.

“He should be given every opportunity to stay in a place of **refuge**,” the statement added.

China **vehemently** denies these allegations.

She **recalls** receiving a text in August from a friend of Guan’s.

Guan’s supporters say he is being held in a Broome County facility in **upstate** New York.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/china-to-raise-tax-condoms-boost-birth-rate

From 1 January, condoms and **contraceptives** will be subject to a 13% VAT rate.

The measure was **buried** in a VAT law passed in 2024 in an effort to modernise China’s tax regime.

China has over the past decade been introducing a **suite** of “carrots” to **induce** people to have more children.

Provinces have been experimenting with offering discounts on **IVF** treatment. Some local governments offer **newlyweds** extra days of paid leave to encourage people to **tie the knot**.

“What is wrong with modern society? They are truly **going to extreme lengths** just to make us have children,” wrote one user on Weibo.

The new VAT law also includes a **tax break** for childcare and “marriage introduction services”.

Women in some areas have reported receiving phone calls from local government officers asking about their **menstrual** cycles and childbearing plans. The local health bureau said the data collection was necessary to identify pregnant and **expectant** mothers.

“They’ll be calling to urge **intercourse** during the **ovulation** period … this is mass **breeding**.”

It **signified** from the government “what desirable family behaviour should be”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/workers-rural-protests-china-land-grabs

Standing inside the temple armed with buckets of rice, the sound of shouting **audible** over banging drums.

A **scuffle** breaks out, some villagers throw handfuls of rice at the officers, a traditional custom for **dispelling** evil, while others **hoist** religious **artefacts** onto their shoulders and march away, past groups of police and other officials.

The **showdown** happened last month. One commenter wrote: “Oh, even their spiritual **solace** is gone.”

“They are frustrated by the lack of economic opportunity and are more prone to volatile **outbursts**,” Chen says.

Two women are **kowtowing**, a traditional gesture performed by those seeking justice.

Tongxing village is a mountainous community, known for its crops of **bayberries**, a small, **prickly**, red fruit.

Several videos collected by China Dissent Monitor appear to **corroborate** the reports. A report published by Chinese media earlier in the summer detailed an ongoing dispute between villagers and a **limestone** mining company to repurpose their land for a **quarry**. Several villagers signed a **petition** opposing the quarry.

However, the state has the power to **requisition** farmland for commercial development.

After several days of intense clashes, a video emerged of villagers appearing to **overpower** local officials, forcing them to kneel.

There is no evidence that the protests are the result of social **contagion** between different places.

But the rapid increase in protests comes at a time of nationwide **malaise** about the sluggish economy, which may fuel **discontent** across different locations.

Firstly, struggling local governments, which collectively are estimated to be **saddled** with at least 44tn yuan ($6.2tn) of debt, need money for public services and to pay salaries. Even though the property sector has plummeted the seized land can still be used as **collateral** to get new loans.

“Land seizures continue to be a major issue because the country is rapidly **urbanising**,” says Rachel Murphy. “Meanwhile, local government **coffers** continue to rely in large part on converting land use from agricultural to non-farm uses”.

While there is no official data on this trend, **anecdotes** **abound**.

The failure of those people to return to work reflects “the **deep-seated** contradictions in the current employment situation of migrant workers”, wrote researchers from Hunan Normal University.

Some in China talk of the “three no’s” to describe the situation of rural migrant workers: no jobs to find, no land to **cultivate**, no place to go”.

Evidence is generally **scrubbed** from social media.

This year, the government has started **rolling out** new service centres in rural areas staffed with social workers, legal advisers and even psychological **counsellors** to mediate disputes before they escalate.

The move by Trump follows Putin strengthening his relationship with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and India’s prime minister, Narenda Modi, at a **showpiece** summit in China.

```
showpiece ~ noun ~ an extremely good example of something that deserves to be admired
```

The US Congress still needs to **sign off** on the transaction.

However analysts suggested it was also designed to **placate** Donald Trump, who has been pressuring Mexico not to act as a “back door” for Chinese goods into the US.

On Thursday, China’s ministry of foreign affairs said Beijing “firmly rejects moves that are taken under coercion to constrain China or undermine China’s legitimate rights and interests under any **pretext**”.

“We will firmly protect our rights and interests **in light of** the developments of the situation,” foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular briefing.

Trump’s tariff regime has **upended** ties and alliances around the world – having moved beyond its original stated purpose of rebalancing trade relationships in the US’s favour, to being **wielded** as a geopolitical tool.

The supreme court is set to hear Trump’s appeal against that **verdict** in the first week of November and the tariffs remain in place ahead of its ruling.

```
placate ~ verb ~ to stop someone from feeling angry

pretext ~ noun ~ a pretended reason for doing something that is used to hide the real reason

upend ~ verb ~ to push or move something so that the part that usually touches the ground is not touching the ground any more

wield ~ verb ~ to hold a weapon or tool and look as if you are going to use it

verdict ~ noun ~ an opinion or decision made after judging the facts that are given, especially one made at the end of a trial

#### [US and China reach deal to transfer TikTok ownership, trade officials say | TikTok | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/15/trump-china-tiktok-sale-ban)

“We would like to stress that the outcomes of the trade and economic consultations are **hard won**” Li said in Madrid.

The Department of Justice last year said TikTok had gathered the sensitive data of American users based off gun control, **abortion** and religion through its use of Lark, a workplace communication platform similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams, according to court documents.

Security experts have long pointed to three main areas of concern: Chinese influence campaigns, mass data collection on US citizens, and potential vulnerabilities that could **compromise** users’ devices.

The TikTok ownership saga stretches back to 2020, when Trump first ordered ByteDance to **divest** TikTok or face a shutdown. Microsoft initially pursued a potential **acquisition** worth billions of dollars, with CEO Satya Nadella engaging directly with Trump, but it fell apart in what Nadella dubbed at the time “the strangest deal” he has ever worked on.

Soon after, Walmart and Oracle came close to buying TikTok’s US **arm**, proposing a joint acquisition of a new entity called TikTok Global, but it was shelved indefinitely after the Biden administration conducted its own review of Chinese tech companies.

“We’re not going to be in the business of having **repetitive** extensions,” Greer said. “We have a deal.”

```
abortion ~ noun ~ the intentional ending of a pregnancy

compromise ~ verb ~ to allow your principles to be less strong or your standards or morals to be lower

divest ~ verb ~ to sell something, especially a business or a part of a business

arm ~ noun ~ a long, moving part of a machine or piece of equipment

repetitive ~ adjective ~ involving doing or saying the same thing several times, especially in a way that is boring:

#### [Chinese economy slows amid Trump trade war and weaker consumer spending | Chinese economy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/chinese-economy-weakens-as-consumer-spending-and-factory-output-slows)

The disappointing data adds pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus to fend off a sharp slowdown, with a debt crisis denting the country’s once-booming property sector and exports facing stronger **headwinds**.

A spokesperson for China’s statistics bureau said on Monday that more efforts were needed to support China’s **ailing** property sector and that the “external environment is very severe”.

Although the two countries agreed a pause on tariffs until 10 November, China recorded a **slump** in US-bound exports last month.

“The activity data point to a further loss of **momentum**,” Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.

Authorities are leaning on manufacturers to find new markets to **offset** Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies and weak consumer spending.

“Policies and measures to support service consumption are expected to offset the impact of **aggregate** demand this month,” he said.

```
headwind ~ noun ~ a wind blowing in the opposite direction to the one you are moving in

ailing ~ adjective ~ experiencing difficulty and problems

slump ~ verb ~ (of prices, values, or sales) to fall suddenly

momentum ~ noun ~ the force that keeps an object moving

offset ~ verb ~ to balance one influence against an opposing influence, so that there is no great difference as a result

But that certainty shifted slightly this month when the threat **catapulted** into the headlines, as Beijing used a military parade commemorating Japan’s defeat in the second world war to unveil a range of new military hardware – including a weapon dubbed the “Guam Killer” by Chinese media.

For that reason, displays of China’s increasing military **prowess** – this month’s event included nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles, anti-drone **lasers** and four-legged “robot wolves” – **loom** large in the territory.

“Guam should be aware of the threat, even if not so worried,” says Col Grant Newsham, a retired US marine officer, noting that the Chinese military has **outpace** the US in some areas.

“That can alter regional and global diplomacy and make coordinated actions more likely. It’s alarming because it can be a military and security **allegiance**,” Reilly says.

Local officials, however, continue to insist that defending Guam is of **paramount** importance to the US military.

```
catapult ~ verb ~ to throw someone or something with great force

prowess ~ noun ~ great ability or skill

laser ~ noun ~ (a device that produces) a powerful, narrow beam of light that can be used as a tool to cut metal, to perform medical operations, or to create patterns of light for entertainment

loom ~ verb ~ to appear as a large, often frightening or unclear shape or object

outpace ~ verb ~ to move or develop faster than someone or something else

allegiance ~ noun ~ loyalty and support for a ruler, country, group, or belief

paramount ~ adjective ~ more important than anything else

#### [Trump celebrates TikTok deal as Beijing suggests US app would use China’s algorithm | China | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/17/trump-celebrates-tiktok-deal-as-beijing-suggests-us-app-would-use-chinas-algorithm)

At a press conference in Madrid, the deputy head of China’s cyber security **regulator** said the framework of the deal included “**licensing** the algorithm and other intellectual property rights”.

Wang Jingtao said ByteDance would “**entrust** the operation of TikTok’s US user data and content security.”

Some commentators have inferred from these comments that TikTok’s US **spinoff** will retain the Chinese algorithm.

At arguments in the Supreme Court in January, a lawyer for TikTok ByteDance told the justices how difficult it would be to sell the platform to a US company, because Chinese law restricts the sale of the **proprietary** algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful.

American officials have previously warned the algorithm that **fuels** what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect.

“It wouldn’t be in **compliance** if the algorithm is Chinese. There can’t be any shared algorithm with ByteDance,” said a spokesperson for the House Select Committee on China.

```
regulator ~ noun ~ an official who makes certain that the companies who operate a system, such as the national electricity supply, work effectively and fairly

license ~ verb ~ to give someone official permission to do or have something

entrust ~ verb ~ to give someone a thing or a duty for which they are responsible

spinoff ~ noun ~ a product that develops from another more important product

proprietary ~ adjective ~ relating to owning something, or relating to or like an owner

fuel ~ verb ~ to increase a feeling or a type of behaviour or make it stronger

compliance ~ noun ~ the act of doing everything that someone tells or wants you to do
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/china-steps-up-control-rare-earth-exports-national-security-concerns

Foreign manufacturers using Chinese **machinery** or components overseas are now expected to seek permission, although it was unclear how that would be enforced.

“This has **adversely** affected international peace and stability” it said.

The supply of the globally crucial rare-earth elements has become a **contentious** point of trade negotiations between the US and China, tested in April when a first **swathe** of Chinese export restrictions.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-china-tariffs

Wall Street fell sharply after the US president reignited public tensions with the Chinese government, and raised the prospect of another **acrimonious** trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

This would happen on 1 November “or sooner”, he said, hinting that the move could be accelerated should Chinese officials **opt** to retaliate.

“There are many other countermeasures that are, **likewise**, under serious consideration.”

Trump repeatedly **hiked** US tariffs on Chinese goods in the spring.

But talks between officials, amid widespread concern over the impact of such **exorbitant** duties on the world economy, led to a fragile **detente**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/us-stakes-rare-earths-companies-tackle-china-power

“China’s announcement on export controls is **nothing more than** a global supply chain power grab,” he said.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/21/australia-us-critical-minerals-rare-earths-deal-china-explainer

Here are five key **takeaways**.

The first is a proposed **gallium** plant in Western Australia, to be co-located at one of Alcoa’s alumina refineries.

The US is wholly dependent on gallium imports, with China having near complete dominance over its production – it is typically **churned** out as a **byproduct** by the country’s vast network of aluminium **smelters**.

Like much of the critical mineral supply chain, China **priced out** rival gallium producers over several decades until it achieved its monopoly position.

Rare-earth magnets are used in wind turbines, medical devices, **combustion** and electric motors and ballistic missile guidance systems.

The US government is considering investing up to $US300m, but first requires further **due diligence**.

Tim Buckley says it is urgent to position Australia as “more than a **quarry** digging and shipping our raw commodities”.

The mix of government money and public **shareholder** money raises questions over who the projects will sell to, and at what price, given China is the world’s dominant buyer of materials that go into the production of high-grade magnets.

One representative of a critical minerals project told Guardian Australia the company was “**mindful** of the context in which we’ve been funded” and that there’s an assumption they “won’t be making many sales to Chinese customers”.

Australian critical minerals companies have enjoyed a **stellar** several weeks, with share prices rocketing amid hopes a new mineral boom has taken hold.

There is also the **lingering** question over how China will respond.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/chinas-record-high-trade-surplus-reveals-the-difficulty-trump-will-have-in-rebalancing-global-economy

The record trade surplus comes even as exports to the US have plummeted, a reflection of the **bruising** US-China trade war that, despite a recent cooling, has **dampened** the flow of goods between the world’s two largest economies.

Chinese premier Li Qiang said the “mutually destructive consequences of tariffs have become increasingly **evident**”.

That is because the demand in the US for cheap products has not gone away, and few countries can replicate China’s **mammoth** ability to produce consumer goods at scale at low prices.

Chinese households are keen on saving money, a trend exacerbated by the pandemic and real estate crash in China that **wiped out** many people’s savings.

### Taiwan

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/taiwan-convicts-four-former-ruling-party-officials-of-spying-for-china

The four include a former aide to Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, when he was vice-president and for a time during his current presidency, and a senior staffer to Joseph Wu, **then** foreign minister and now the national security chief.

Huang denied **wrongdoing** while Chiu pleaded guilty.

Lai says that such measures, which have been criticised for **muffling** free expression, are necessary to combat “grey zone” infiltrations of Taiwan’s military, government and society.

```
wrongdoing ~ noun ~ a bad or an illegal action

muffle ~ verb ~ to make a sound quieter and less clear
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/china-issues-rewards-for-information-about-taiwan-militarys-psychological-warfare-unit

In a separate report, the state-controlled Chinese news agency Xinhua said they created **seditious** games to incite secession.

Taiwan’s defence ministry said the accusations reflected the “**despotic** and **pig-headed** thinking of an authoritarian regime.

“Defending national security and protecting the safety and wellbeing of the people is the **unshirkable** duty of every military officer and soldier,” it said.

On Friday, Lai Ching-te pledged greater efforts to boost Taiwan’s defences, calling on China to **renounce** the use of force to seize the island.

Some analysts believe that China is leveraging its rare earths **chokehold** in part to force the US to negotiate over the 20% fentanyl-linked tariffs on Chinese exports.

Amid the **fallout**, Trump has been making rare earths deals with other countries including Australia and Thailand, but the issue will be high on the agenda in his meeting with Xi.

“Taiwan has a lot of things that they’re worried about and **rightfully** so because of the situation they find themselves in,” Rubio told reporters on a plane between Israel and Qatar.

“If what people are worried about is we’re going to get some trade deal or we’re going to get favourable treatment on trade in exchange for walking away from Taiwan, no one is **contemplating** that,” he said.

The vessel is one of the most high profile signs of his long-running efforts to **overhaul** and modernise the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

The KJ-600 early warning and control plane has been successfully tested during its sea **trials**.

China’s navy said it launched the latest J-35 **stealth** fighter and J-15T heavy fighter from the Fujian.

China’s shipbuilding operates at an **unrivalled** pace but is secretive, and observers **scour** state media alerts and satellite images for signs of the latest developments and innovations.

This year the PLA has been testing several new **barge** ships, designed to create a **loading dock** from almost a kilometre out from shore, to bypass **rough seas** and rocky coastlines.

Taiwan’s defensive strategies had long included plans to move its war planes from the vulnerable west coast to the east, where they were protected by a **mountain range**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/08/taiwan-vice-president-presses-case-at-eu-parliament-for-joint-efforts-to-counter-china

“Peace in the Taiwan Strait is essential to global stability and economic **continuity**, and international opposition against unilateral changes to the status quo by force cannot be **overstated**.”

“In an era marked by increasing **fragmentation**, volatility and rising authoritarianism” she added, to a standing **ovation** in a small chamber of the parliament.

She also mentioned China’s disruptions of global supply chains – likely a reference partly to Beijing’s **throttling** of rare earth exports to the EU earlier this year.

China’s **mission** to Europe on Saturday criticised the EU parliament for allowing her to carry out “separatist activities” in its building despite China’s opposition – adding it had made a **representation** to the European side.

The trip and speech were kept **under wraps** because of security concerns.

Ben Bland said the EU and Taiwan could do much more to deepen ties for mutual benefit in the face of worsening US-China **rivalry**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/china-taiwan-statements-longer-term-strategy

“The aim is to **belittle** Taiwan’s international standing, to achieve the political objective of **eliminating** Taiwan’s sovereignty.”

**Retrocession** day, on 25 October is celebrated in Taiwan to mark the end of Japanese colonial rule, but Beijing has **recast** it as the day Taiwan was returned to China – specifically the China now ruled by the CCP.

Germany’s foreign minister said his country’s long standing position opposed “violent change” in the status quo that keeps the **tenuous** peace in the Taiwan Strait.

“Those who only call for no change of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait are actually aiding and **abetting** ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities**,**”

“Every inch of Taiwan Province, China, is **vibrant** under the “Jilin-1” space satellite’s perspective.”

In Taiwan, people and officials called the photos **voyeuristic**.

“If the point that China is trying to make with these satellite pictures is that it owns everything it took pictures of, then that’s just plain **immature**.”

Chinese officials sought to brush off the **characterisation**. “It is normal for Chinese satellites to look at the **magnificent** mountains and rivers of China’s Taiwan.”

These moves could help “prepare ground” for Xi seeking US **concessions** on its protection of Taiwan.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/25/china-taiwan-xi-jinping-call-with-donald-trump

China is embroiled in a weeks-long diplomatic row with key US ally Japan over the island that has seen a **dip** in Chinese tourism to Japan.

A **tentative** deal reached in October’s meeting in South Korea.

Meanwhile, Beijing would buy at least 12m **metric** tons of American soya beans by the end of this year.

He added that the “successful” meeting in South Korea “**recalibrated** the course of the giant ship of China-US relations”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/26/taiwan-extra-40bn-defence-spending-china-threat

Lai and defence minister announced the spending **bump** – an increase of at least $8bn on what had previously been flagged.

“History has proven that compromising with aggression only brings war and **enslavement**,” he said.

He said Beijing’s offer of a Hong Kong-style ‘one country two systems’ governance under Chinese rule should be formally considered an “**inviolable** red line for Taiwanese society”.

A spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, Peng Qingen, earlier told a press briefing that Taiwan was **squandering** money on “**currying** favour with external powers”.

China’s government accused Japan of deliberately **stoking** regional tensions.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/us-announces-more-than-10bn-of-arms-sales-to-taiwan

Donald Trump made **scant** mention of foreign policy issues. US-Chinese tensions have **ebbed** and flowed during Trump’s second term.

The eight arms sales agreements announced on Wednesday cover 82 **high-mobility** artillery rocket systems. They also include 60 self-propelled **howitzer** systems.

Other sales in the package include helicopter spare parts worth $96m and **refurbishment** kits.

In separate but nearly **identical** statements, the state department said the sales serve “US national, economic and security interests.”

“The ‘Taiwan independence’ forces on the island seek independence through force, **squandering** the **hard-earned** money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a **powder keg**,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.

“This cannot save the **doomed fate** of ‘Taiwan independence’. The US support for ‘Taiwan Independence’ through arms will only end up **backfiring**. Using Taiwan to **contain** China will not succeed,” he added.

But the push towards greater weapons sales has been **impeded** by Trump’s **erratic** stance on Taiwan.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/26/china-imposes-sanctions-on-us-defence-firms-over-taiwan-arms-deal

China’s stance on Taiwan has been a **pinch point** in its relations with the US, already **worn thin** over trade and tariff issues.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/29/china-live-fire-military-drills-around-taiwan

The PLA’s eastern theatre command said it had deployed destroyers, **frigates**, fighters, bombers, drones and long-range missiles “**in close proximity**” to Taiwan.

By Monday afternoon, Taiwan’s defence ministry said it had detected 28 navy and coastguard ships, including two that entered Taiwan’s **contiguous zone**. A formation of four **amphibious** assault ships, which can carry dozens of **rotary** aircraft, was spotted 160 nautical miles west of Taiwan’s southern tip.

“Any sinister **schemes** to **obstruct** China’s reunification are doomed to fail,” Lin said.

“Despite repeated warnings from China, the US and Taiwan engaged in serious **collusion** and provocation.”

A propaganda poster depicted **flaming arrows** shot from China to Taiwan’s main island.

Justice Mission 2025 is the sixth major PLA military exercise targeting Taiwan since 2022, when it launched days of live-fire drills in retaliation for the then US **speaker**, Nancy Pelosi, visiting the island.

### Japan

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/21/sanae-takaichi-japan-first-female-pm-appoints-two-women-to-cabinet

Takaichi, an ultra-conservative whose Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has formed a coalition with a minor party that shares her hawkish approach to defence and **revisionist** views on wartime history, has said she wants to raise awareness of women’s health and has spoken about her own experience of **menopause**.

But like her political hero Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi will be guided by the social conservatism that made her the popular choice among MPs and **rank-and-file** members on the right of the LDP when she ran for the party leadership this month.

She opposes revising a 19th-century law requiring married couples to use the same surname, arguing that allowing women to retain their **maiden** names would **chip away** at traditional family values.

She also opposes calls for changes to succession laws to allow female members of the **imperial household** – which has few male heirs – to become **reigning** **empresses**.

Takaichi had a **comparatively** small pool of female MPs from which to appoint her cabinet.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/11/japan-china-row-takaichi-taiwan-conflict-military-deployment

“The so-called Taiwan **contingency** has become so serious that we have to anticipate a worst-case scenario.”

“We have no choice but cut off that dirty neck that has been **lunged** at us without hesitation.”

Japan has long **wrestled** with the question of how it would respond to a conflict between China and Taiwan, which lies just 100km from its westernmost island, **Yonaguni**, in the East China Sea.

Lin Jian said Xue’s post was a response to Takaichi’s “**wrongful** and dangerous” remarks on Taiwan.

“China strongly urges Japan to **reflect** on its historical **culpability** on the Taiwan issue.”

“Such behaviour clearly exceeds diplomatic **etiquette**.”

This latest spat started just a week after Beijing accused Takaichi of “**egregious**” behaviour by meeting with a senior adviser to Taiwan’s president.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/15/china-advises-against-travel-to-japan-amid-escalating-row-over-pms-taiwan-comments

Sanae Takaichi told Japan’s parliament on 7 November that the use of force against the self-ruled island claimed by China could **warrant** a military response from Tokyo.

In the **since-removed** statement on social media, Xue posted about “(cutting) off that dirty neck”. Japan’s ruling party has since passed a resolution calling for the envoy to be declared **persona non grata**.

Takaichi, a conservative and China hawk, has toned down her rhetoric since **assuming office** last month.

If an emergency in Taiwan **entails** “**battleships** and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival of Japan, **any way you slice it**”, she said.

Despite the escalating diplomatic spat, Takaichi has since indicated she has no intention of **retracting** her statement.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/16/china-sends-coast-guard-to-senkaku-islands-amid-row-with-japan

China and Japan have repeatedly **faced off** around the islands.

Chinese military **transits** there are not rare.

China’s consul general in Osaka prompted a formal protest from Tokyo by commenting that “the dirty head that **sticks** itself out must be cut off”.

China’s defence ministry declared that any Japanese intervention would be **doomed to fail**.

Three Chinese airlines said on Saturday that tickets to Japan could be **refunded** or changed for free.

Late on Saturday, a Chinese state media editorial accused Takaichi of staging a **political stunt** that was “not just dangerously provocative but fundamentally **perverse**”.

“A conflict between Japan and China would not be a limited **skirmish**.”

However, China’s ruling Communist party says the unification of Taiwan with the People’s Republic of China is “inevitable”, and casts any opposition to it as **escalatory**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/17/china-travel-warning-for-japan-sends-shares-in-tourism-and-retail-companies-plunging

The comments triggered a furious response from Beijing, including a coastguard **sail-by** through the disputed Senkaku islands at the weekend.

In morning trade on Monday, shares in the Japanese **cosmetics** firm Shiseido fell 9%.

Japan’s **self-imposed** rules say that it can act militarily only under certain conditions.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/17/china-and-japan-are-in-a-war-of-words-over-taiwan-what-happens-next

The quarrel **kicked off** after Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested Japan could become militarily involved in a conflict between China and Taiwan.

“The so-called Taiwan contingency has become so serious that we have to anticipate a **worst-case** scenario,” Takaichi said.

Takaichi **hails from** the right of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and shares hawkish views on China once **espoused** by Shinzo Abe.

On Monday, China’s embassy in Japan posted on its social media a reminder that it had not **renounced** using force to take Taiwan.

In the **immediate term**, the row is more likely to have an impact on bilateral economic and people-to-people ties between the key trading partners.

“I also urge China to exercise restraint and demonstrate the conduct **befitting** a major power, rather than becoming a troublemaker for regional peace and stability,” Lai said.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/chinese-travellers-estimated-to-have-cancelled-500000-flights-to-japan-amid-rising-tensions

Sichuan Airlines had cancelled all flights between Chengdu and **Sapporo** from January until late March, and the **budget carrier** Spring Airlines had cancelled “multiple” Japan flights.

China is the second largest source of tourists to Japan, and its students form the bulk of Japan’s international student **cohort**. Shares in Japanese retail and travel companies **slumped** on Monday in response to the measures.

The travel cancellations are among a growing list of economic countermeasures after what had until Sunday been mostly a **rhetorical** reaction.

The Chinese **polling** partner told the Guardian that the questions were asked before the dispute began and the results “do not represent the current state of China-Japan relations”.

State media have claimed that **box office** sales for an already released Japanese film, Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, have slumped in recent days.

The prospect of Japanese involvement in the event of an attack on Taiwan is **alarming** for Beijing.

China’s state media have given the spat **blanket** coverage.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/china-suspends-seafood-imports-from-japan-as-taiwan-row-escalates

The original ban was imposed in response to Japan’s decision to release wastewater from the damaged and **decommissioned** Fukushima nuclear plant.

“I would also like to emphasise that due to Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi’s recent actions that **go against the tide** and her **erroneous** remarks on major issues such as Taiwan, which have triggered strong public outrage in China, there would be no market for Japanese seafood in the current climate even if Japan were able to export it to China.”

Over the weekend, China sent a coastguard fleet through the disputed waters around the Senkaku Islands and military drones past Japan’s most **westerly** territory, Yonaguni Island, close to Taiwan’s east coast.

On Tuesday, China’s **permanent representative** to the UN, Fu Cong, told a forum that Japan was “totally unqualified” for a permanent seat on the UN security council, citing Takaichi’s remarks.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/24/japan-pm-sanae-takaichi-g20-summit-china-public-support

When she selected her **wardrobe** for this weekend’s G20 summit in South Africa, Sanae Takaichi took extra care to choose something that – in her words – would “give her the upper hand” in negotiations.

But she never got the opportunity to test the theory in what would have been her most **pressing engagement** – talks with the Chinese premier.

Instead, they kept their distance during a group photoshoot on Saturday – setting a **frosty** tone that would continue for the rest of the summit, despite speculation that a brief handshake and exchange of **courtesies** was a possibility.

She did not, though, agree to Beijing’s main condition for an end to the row – a retraction of her assertion this month that Japan would be **entitled** to engage in “collective self-defence” if an emergency in the Taiwan Strait created a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan.

Given the scale of their economic ties, the measures are comparatively minor, but they could also be the **harbinger** of more serious retaliation.

But her **intransigence** over Taiwan is doing her little harm with the public.

**Tellingly**, almost 49% supported Japan’s right to engage in collective self-defence in the event of a Taiwan crisis, compared with 44.2% against.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/08/japan-china-radar-fighter-jets-claims

China’s government has **roundly** rejected Japan’s accusations, instead lodging its own **counterprotests**.

A fire-control radar lock signals a potential attack, forcing the targeted aircraft to take **evasive** action.

The Japanese defence minister said on Sunday the incident was “dangerous and extremely **regrettable**”.

“These radar **illuminations** went beyond what is necessary for the safe flight of aircraft,” he said.

China has disputed Japan’s claims as “completely inconsistent with the facts”, instead accusing Japan’s self-defence forces of having “**maliciously** followed and harassed” its Liaoning aircraft carrier group while it was conducting training drills.

The Japan side was “repeatedly sending aircraft to intrude into the exercise and training zones that China had **demarcated** and announced in advance,” said senior Col Zhang Xiaogang.

Chinese state media has also revived a campaign questioning Japan’s territorial claims over the **Ryuku** Island chain, which includes Okinawa.

As a safety worker for bungee jumps and rope **swings**, Mr Fu has spent a lot of time standing on bridges. But his new job, working at the new Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge in Southern China, **takes the cake**.

“Standing on it yourself feels **thrilling** as well.”

The bridge offers bungee jumping and **slack**-lining, and there are plans for professional **Base jumping** events, according to state media.

The Philippines said a Chinese coast guard ship “fired its water cannon” at the BRP Datu Pagbuaya, a vessel belonging to Manila’s **fisheries** bureau, at 9.15am on Sunday.

Just three minutes later … the same Chinese vessel deliberately rammed the **stern**” of the Philippine boat.

Beijing blamed the Philippines for the **collision**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/china-spy-row-key-witness-statement-to-be-published-says-starmer

Keir Starmer was forced to promise to publish witness statements from the UK’s deputy national security adviser in an effort to **draw a line** under a row over why charges against two Britons accused of spying for China were dropped.

Starmer said at prime minister’s questions it was “absolutely not” the case and said Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition, had made a “completely **scurrilous** allegation”.

Starmer turned his fire on the Tories, saying that “it was their failure and they are just **slinging** mud”.

Starmer added that Collins was a “civil servant of the utmost **integrity**” and that his witness statement had been made without political input.

“He had to be dragged out to repeat only more **obfuscation**.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/17/china-accuses-uk-of-bad-faith-over-delayed-embassy-project

Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, told a press conference in Beijing on Friday that the UK had shown “disregard for **contractual** spirit, acting in bad faith and without integrity”.

He said China had acted with “the utmost sincerity and patience” and the UK should “immediately fulfil its obligations and **honour** its commitments otherwise the British side shall bear all consequences”.

The prime minister’s spokesperson told reporters on Friday that the decision over the embassy was **quasi**-judicial and “independent of the rest of government”.

Oliver Robbins, the head of the Foreign Office, is in China this week discussing the embassy application and the **refurbishments** Britain wants to carry out on its own embassy in Beijing.

But those attempts have faced multiple **hurdles**, including the two recent rows over spying and the proposed new embassy.

Beijing bought the site of the **prospective** embassy near the Tower of London for £255m in 2018. Tower Hamlets council refused permission for the project in 2022, prompting **wrangling** over whether it could go ahead.

That deadline was pushed back until 21 October after China **redacted** large portions of its plans for what it said were security reasons.

Meanwhile, reports suggest Beijing has been accessing **classified** material on British servers for several years, renewing concerns that it could use the new embassy to bolster its surveillance efforts.

Western said the proposed location posed “**eavesdropping** risks in peacetime and sabotage risks in a crisis” **owing to** its proximity to fibre-optic cables, datacentres and telecoms exchanges serving Canary Wharf and the City.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/xi-jinping-cracks-joke-about-spying-with-phones-given-to-south-korean-president

Xi, who is not known for public displays of humour, laughed and smiled as Lee’s **quip** was translated into Chinese, before displaying some sharp **wit** of his own.

The **lighthearted** exchange took place as Xi and Lee exchanged gifts on the sidelines of the Apec summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju – Xi’s first visit to the country in more than a decade.

The leaders’ conversation, captured by TV cameras, generated huge media interest in South Korea as Xi rarely **cracks jokes**, especially on a subject as sensitive as espionage.

A state media live feed of the **trio** walking into Tiananmen Square caught Putin’s interpreter saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”

“Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and even achieve **immortality**,” he added.

Lee’s spokesperson, Kim Nam-joon, said the moment of **levity** was proof that the two leaders had bonded during several meetings at the two-day summit.

Xi, who like Lee is a **keen** player of the ancient strategy board game, described the board as “**exquisite**”, according to South Korean media.

“The Shenzhou-20 **crewed** spacecraft is suspected to have been struck by a small piece of **orbital** debris,” said the China **Manned** Space Agency in a statement.

Authorities didn’t say when the incident is believed to have occurred. There was no indication of any issues earlier this week, with state media reporting on the two crews enjoying a meal of **baked** chicken cooked on the space station’s first ever oven, delivered by the Shenzhou-21 team.

“Shenzhou-22 and the Long March 2F (launcher) were already on **standby**.

The returning Shenzhou-20 team’s commander, Chen Dong, already holds a Chinese record for the longest **cumulative** spaceflight.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/08/us-china-aircraft-carriers-naval-fleet-defence

In a new era of state competition, Aircraft carriers remain an attractive resource for projecting power and conducting harder **edged** diplomacy.

It is a demonstration of Beijing’s fast-growing military power: its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, completed in 2012, was built from a **hulk** first made in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and sold on by Ukraine after its collapse.

**Ironically**, China has also invested heavily in anti-ship missiles to try to protect its coast from the US. But Beijing clearly sees “aircraft carriers as an **indispensable** element in building a navy that can independently project power and influence globally”, because they remain “unrivalled in their flexibility” and are “**incredibly** useful in a whole range of potential conflict scenarios”.

Their use so far has been as a form of **floating** diplomacy.

For now, aircraft carriers are not expected to meet a military threat with the tactical **sophistication** of Ukraine, never mind a peer-level opponent.

The Soviet **rule of thumb** in the cold war was that it would take 12 conventional missiles to bring down a super-carrier.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/11/china-co2-emissions-flat-or-falling-for-past-18-months-analysis-finds

Rapid increases in the deployment of solar and wind power generation – which grew by 46% and 11% **respectively** in the third quarter of this year – meant the country’s energy sector emissions remained flat, even as the demand for electricity increased.

China’s CO2 emissions were unchanged from a year earlier in the third quarter of 2025, thanks **in part** to declining emissions in the travel, **cement** and steel industries.

Last week, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the world was facing a “**moral** failure and deadly **negligence**” if governments failed to limit global heating to 1.5C.

Experts say those targets are too **modest** to **stave off** global catastrophe and a long way from the 30% cut that is feasible and necessary.

But China has a record of **underpromising** and **overdelivering** on climate targets.

Myllyvirta said some areas of the economy were **bucking** the **decarbonisation** trend.

China is also on track to miss its target for cutting carbon intensity – the CO2 emissions per unit of **gross** domestic product – between 2020 and 2025. This means steeper **reductions** will be necessary if the country is to hit its 2030 goal of reducing carbon intensity by 65%, compared with 2005.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/watch-out-online-contact-chinese-spies-uk-defence-minister-warns-public

Luke Pollard said a warning given to parliamentarians on Tuesday that China was attempting to recruit individuals with access to sensitive information should also be **heeded** by the public at large.

“Because as we become more online as a community, the ability for people that wish us harm or wish us to gain access to information they shouldn’t have access to becomes more **plentiful**.”

The security minister, Dan Jarvis, said in parliament on Tuesday it was “a covert and **calculated**” attempt by the Chinese government to recruit people close to power.

In response, Beijing accused the UK spy agency of “groundlessly **hyping** up” the issue.

The Crown Prosecution Service said it had been forced to abandon the case after the government failed to provide reassurance that China was “a current threat to national security”, a **threshold** that needed to be met to go ahead with the prosecution.

The **wording** of the 1911 law around espionage refers to gathering information “directly or indirectly useful to an enemy”, a definition that could have strained the UK’s already fragile relationship with the superpower.

A deadly fire in an apartment complex in Hong Kong appears to have spread in part because the buildings were **sheathed** in bamboo **scaffolding**.

The **intricate** **lattices** of poles bound together by zip ties and wrapped around **gleaming** sky-scrapers are a **ubiquitous** sight across the city.

The natural **variation** in the size and shape of the poles means that binding them together into a scaffold requires the skilled eye of bamboo master.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/02/uk-government-delays-china-super-embassy-january

That would be China’s biggest diplomatic **outpost** in the world. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that **consolidating** China’s seven existing diplomatic sites in London into a single embassy “clearly brings security advantages”.

In a speech on Monday night, he argued that the government could not continue to **blow “hot and cold”** on China and needed to strike a balance.

He described China as a “nation of immense scale, ambition and **ingenuity**” and “a **defining** force in technology, in trade and global governance”.

“Our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by **illusion**. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and **sober** realism,” Starmer said.

Yvette Cooper said their departments had “carefully considered the **breadth** of considerations” related to the proposed embassy.
