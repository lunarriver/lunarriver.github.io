#### [2025-07-01 Kim Jong-un pays rare public tribute to North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/kim-jong-un-tribute-north-korea-soldiers-killed-ukraine-fighting)

Kim Jong-un has paid **tribute** to North Korean soldiers killed during Russia’s war with Ukraine, resting his hands on their repatriated **coffins** in a rare public acknowledgment that his armed forces have suffered fatalities in the conflict.

Photographs of the North Korean leader pausing in front of a line of half a dozen coffins draped in the country’s flag were displayed on a screen at a **gala** performance held on Sunday to mark the first anniversary of a military treaty between the North and Russia.

The event at East Pyongyang Grand Theatre combined performances by North Korean and visiting Russian artists with images celebrating a mutual defence pact agreed by Kim and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Pyongyang in June last year.

The scenes showing Kim and the remains of fallen soldiers followed those of troops from both countries waving their national flags. One image purportedly showed pages from a blood-**stained** notebook, believed to have belonged to a North Korean soldier, that had been **retrieved** from a battlefield in Russia’s Kursk region.

According to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, the messages in the notebook read: “The **decisive** moment has finally come,” and “Let us bravely fight this sacred battle with the boundless love and trust **bestowed** upon us by our **beloved** Supreme Commander” – a reference to Kim.

It was not immediately clear when the repatriation ceremony took place. Kim and other officials, including his influential sister, Kim Yo-jong, and the foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, are wearing winter clothing, suggesting that the soldiers’ remains may have been returned to the North several months ago.

Having denied for months that North Korean soldiers had been sent to fight alongside Russian forces, the regime is now attempting to put a positive **spin** on its involvement in the Ukraine conflict.

“North Korea probably wanted to frame the fallen soldiers not just as sacrifices but as part of a victory narrative,” Hong Min, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told Yonhap.

“The footage appears to have been released after the two countries acknowledged the troop deployment” and declared their joint operation to reclaim the Kursk region in western Russia a success, Hong added.

Footage of the gala broadcast by North Korea’s state KRT television showed Kim, who appeared emotional at times, sitting alongside his guest, the Russian culture minister, Olga Lyubimova, and his daughter, Kim Ju-ae. People in the audience were shown wiping away tears.

The Korea Herald said the event was the first time state media had shown footage and photos of soldiers sent to Russia that can be seen by North Korean citizens.

The state-run KCNA news agency said the event had inspired confidence in the “ties of friendship and the genuine internationalist obligation between the peoples and armies of the two countries that were forged at the cost of blood”.

In April, Putin and Kim confirmed for the first time that North Korean troops had been deployed, with both leaders describing them as “heroes”.

Kim said at the time that a **monument** would be built in Pyongyang to honour his soldiers, and that flowers would be laid before the tombstones of those who had died – seen as the first public confirmation by the regime that its troops had been killed in combat.

The North has sent an estimated 15,000 troops to fight in the war since last autumn. It has suffered about 4,700 casualties, including 600 deaths, South Korean lawmakers said in April, while Seoul’s intelligence agency recently claimed that additional deployments could come in July or August.

North Korea has also provided Russia with large quantities of ammunition, artillery shells, ballistic missiles and other weapons, reportedly in return for weapons and satellite technology, and economic and other assistance from the Kremlin.

#### [2025-07-01 Ukraine war briefing: Russia claims to have seized all of Luhansk region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-claims-to-have-seized-all-of-luhansk-region-and-first-village-in-dnipropetrovsk)

Moscow’s forces have seized all of Luhansk – one of four regions Russia illegally annexed from Ukraine in September 2022 despite not fully controlling a single one – Leonid Pasechnik, a Russia-appointed official there, said on Monday. If confirmed, that would make Luhansk the first Ukrainian region to be fully occupied by Russia after more than three years of war. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv on Pasechnik’s claim. In remarks to Russia’s state TV Channel One that aired Monday evening, Pasechnik said he had received a report “**literally** two days ago” saying that “100%” of the region was now under the control of Russian forces.

Russian forces have captured a village in the Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk for the first time in their three-year offensive, Russian state media and pro-war bloggers have claimed. Dnipropetrovsk, which lies to the west of the Donetsk region, is not among the five Ukrainian regions over which Russia has asserted a formal territorial claim. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukrainian officials or from the Russian defence ministry.

North Korea’s state media showed on Monday leader Kim Jong-un draping coffins with the national flag in what appeared to be the repatriation of soldiers killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine, as the countries marked a **landmark** military treaty. In a series of photographs displayed in the backdrop of a gala performance by North Korean and visiting Russian artists in Pyongyang, Kim is seen by rows of a half a dozen coffins, covering them with flags and pausing **briefly** with both hands resting on them.

The European Union said Monday it had agreed a new long-term trade deal with Ukraine, covering imports of food products from the **war-torn** country that have angered EU farmers. Brussels and Kyiv have been **wrangling** over the deal after protests from farmers saw the EU slap **quotas** on tariff-free Ukrainian agricultural imports into the bloc. Brussels added certain restrictions in 2024, when it extended the agreement for one additional year, by introducing a maximum **ceiling** on certain tariff-free products such as **cereals**, **poultry**, eggs, sugar and corn. The European Commission said that under the new deal – which still needs to be finalised – quotas would remain for those sensitive agricultural areas. In return, Kyiv will cut its quotas for pork, poultry and sugar imported from the EU and push to align its food production standards with those of the 27-nation bloc by 2028, Brussels said.

The International Monetary Fund said on Monday it has completed its eighth review of Ukraine’s \$15.5bn four-year support program, paving the way for a **disbursement** of an additional \$500m to the war-torn country. That will bring total disbursements to $10.6bn, the IMF said in a statement, after its board’s approval of the review of Ukraine’s Extended Fund Facility. It warned of **ongoing** and “exceptionally high” risks to the country’s **outlook**.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “wants to **subjugate** the whole of Ukraine and at the same time spread fear throughout Europe,” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on a visit to Kyiv on Monday, adding that Putin’s “alleged willingness to negotiate is just a **facade**.” Kyiv and its allies have accused Russia of sabotaging diplomatic efforts, which have stalled in recent weeks, despite Washington’s desires to reach a quick peace deal.

US President Donald Trump’s senior envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellog also said on Monday that Russia cannot continue to stall for time “while it bombs civilian targets in Ukraine.” “We urge an immediate ceasefire and a move to **trilateral** talks to end the war,” Kellogg wrote on X.
