#### [2025-07-01 Kim Jong-un pays rare public tribute to North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/kim-jong-un-tribute-north-korea-soldiers-killed-ukraine-fighting)

Kim Jong-un has paid **tribute** to North Korean soldiers killed during Russia’s war with Ukraine, resting his hands on their repatriated **coffins** in a rare public acknowledgment that his armed forces have suffered fatalities in the conflict.

Photographs of the North Korean leader pausing in front of a line of half a dozen coffins draped in the country’s flag were displayed on a screen at a **gala** performance held on Sunday to mark the first anniversary of a military treaty between the North and Russia.

The event at East Pyongyang Grand Theatre combined performances by North Korean and visiting Russian artists with images celebrating a mutual defence pact agreed by Kim and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Pyongyang in June last year.

The scenes showing Kim and the remains of fallen soldiers followed those of troops from both countries waving their national flags. One image purportedly showed pages from a blood-**stained** notebook, believed to have belonged to a North Korean soldier, that had been **retrieved** from a battlefield in Russia’s Kursk region.

According to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, the messages in the notebook read: “The **decisive** moment has finally come,” and “Let us bravely fight this sacred battle with the boundless love and trust **bestowed** upon us by our **beloved** Supreme Commander” – a reference to Kim.

It was not immediately clear when the repatriation ceremony took place. Kim and other officials, including his influential sister, Kim Yo-jong, and the foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, are wearing winter clothing, suggesting that the soldiers’ remains may have been returned to the North several months ago.

Having denied for months that North Korean soldiers had been sent to fight alongside Russian forces, the regime is now attempting to put a positive **spin** on its involvement in the Ukraine conflict.

“North Korea probably wanted to frame the fallen soldiers not just as sacrifices but as part of a victory narrative,” Hong Min, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told Yonhap.

“The footage appears to have been released after the two countries acknowledged the troop deployment” and declared their joint operation to reclaim the Kursk region in western Russia a success, Hong added.

Footage of the gala broadcast by North Korea’s state KRT television showed Kim, who appeared emotional at times, sitting alongside his guest, the Russian culture minister, Olga Lyubimova, and his daughter, Kim Ju-ae. People in the audience were shown wiping away tears.

The Korea Herald said the event was the first time state media had shown footage and photos of soldiers sent to Russia that can be seen by North Korean citizens.

The state-run KCNA news agency said the event had inspired confidence in the “ties of friendship and the genuine internationalist obligation between the peoples and armies of the two countries that were forged at the cost of blood”.

In April, Putin and Kim confirmed for the first time that North Korean troops had been deployed, with both leaders describing them as “heroes”.

Kim said at the time that a **monument** would be built in Pyongyang to honour his soldiers, and that flowers would be laid before the tombstones of those who had died – seen as the first public confirmation by the regime that its troops had been killed in combat.

The North has sent an estimated 15,000 troops to fight in the war since last autumn. It has suffered about 4,700 casualties, including 600 deaths, South Korean lawmakers said in April, while Seoul’s intelligence agency recently claimed that additional deployments could come in July or August.

North Korea has also provided Russia with large quantities of ammunition, artillery shells, ballistic missiles and other weapons, reportedly in return for weapons and satellite technology, and economic and other assistance from the Kremlin.

#### [2025-07-01 Ukraine war briefing: Russia claims to have seized all of Luhansk region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-claims-to-have-seized-all-of-luhansk-region-and-first-village-in-dnipropetrovsk)

Moscow’s forces have seized all of Luhansk – one of four regions Russia illegally annexed from Ukraine in September 2022 despite not fully controlling a single one – Leonid Pasechnik, a Russia-appointed official there, said on Monday. If confirmed, that would make Luhansk the first Ukrainian region to be fully occupied by Russia after more than three years of war. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv on Pasechnik’s claim. In remarks to Russia’s state TV Channel One that aired Monday evening, Pasechnik said he had received a report “**literally** two days ago” saying that “100%” of the region was now under the control of Russian forces.

Russian forces have captured a village in the Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk for the first time in their three-year offensive, Russian state media and pro-war bloggers have claimed. Dnipropetrovsk, which lies to the west of the Donetsk region, is not among the five Ukrainian regions over which Russia has asserted a formal territorial claim. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukrainian officials or from the Russian defence ministry.

North Korea’s state media showed on Monday leader Kim Jong-un draping coffins with the national flag in what appeared to be the repatriation of soldiers killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine, as the countries marked a **landmark** military treaty. In a series of photographs displayed in the backdrop of a gala performance by North Korean and visiting Russian artists in Pyongyang, Kim is seen by rows of a half a dozen coffins, covering them with flags and pausing **briefly** with both hands resting on them.

The European Union said Monday it had agreed a new long-term trade deal with Ukraine, covering imports of food products from the **war-torn** country that have angered EU farmers. Brussels and Kyiv have been **wrangling** over the deal after protests from farmers saw the EU slap **quotas** on tariff-free Ukrainian agricultural imports into the bloc. Brussels added certain restrictions in 2024, when it extended the agreement for one additional year, by introducing a maximum **ceiling** on certain tariff-free products such as **cereals**, **poultry**, eggs, sugar and corn. The European Commission said that under the new deal – which still needs to be finalised – quotas would remain for those sensitive agricultural areas. In return, Kyiv will cut its quotas for pork, poultry and sugar imported from the EU and push to align its food production standards with those of the 27-nation bloc by 2028, Brussels said.

The International Monetary Fund said on Monday it has completed its eighth review of Ukraine’s \$15.5bn four-year support program, paving the way for a **disbursement** of an additional \$500m to the war-torn country. That will bring total disbursements to $10.6bn, the IMF said in a statement, after its board’s approval of the review of Ukraine’s Extended Fund Facility. It warned of **ongoing** and “exceptionally high” risks to the country’s **outlook**.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “wants to **subjugate** the whole of Ukraine and at the same time spread fear throughout Europe,” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on a visit to Kyiv on Monday, adding that Putin’s “alleged willingness to negotiate is just a **facade**.” Kyiv and its allies have accused Russia of sabotaging diplomatic efforts, which have stalled in recent weeks, despite Washington’s desires to reach a quick peace deal.

US President Donald Trump’s senior envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellog also said on Monday that Russia cannot continue to stall for time “while it bombs civilian targets in Ukraine.” “We urge an immediate ceasefire and a move to **trilateral** talks to end the war,” Kellogg wrote on X.

#### [2025-07-02 Quad countries agree to diversify critical mineral supplies amid China concerns](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/02/quad-countries-agree-to-diversify-critical-mineral-supplies-amid-china-concerns)

The United States, Japan, India and Australia have pledged to work together to ensure a stable supply of critical minerals, as worries grow over China’s dominance in resources vital to new technologies.

The four countries said in a joint statement that they were establishing the Quad Critical Minerals Initiative, aimed at “collaborating on securing and **diversifying**” supply chains.

They offered little detail but made clear the goal was to reduce reliance on China, which has used restrictions **as leverage** as the US in turn curbs its access to semiconductors and threatens steep tariffs.

China holds major reserves of several key minerals including the vast majority of the world’s **graphite**, which is crucial for electric vehicles.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio welcomed his counterparts from the so-called “Quad” grouping to Washington on Tuesday in a shift of focus to Asia, after spending much of his first six months on the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and on president Donald Trump’s domestic priorities, such as migration.

In brief remarks alongside the other ministers, Rubio said he has “personally been very focused” on diversifying supply chains and wanted “real progress”.

In a joint statement, the Quad countries said: “Reliance on any one country for processing and refining critical minerals and **derivative** goods production exposes our industries to economic coercion, price manipulation and supply chain disruptions.”

The ministers were careful not to mention China by name but also voiced “serious concerns regarding dangerous and provocative actions” in the South China Sea and East China Sea that “threaten peace and stability in the region”.

Rubio had welcomed the Quad foreign ministers on 21 January in his first meeting after Trump’s inauguration, seen as a sign the new administration would prioritise engagement with **like-minded** countries to counter China.

But to the surprise of many, China has not topped the **early agenda** of Trump, who has spoken respectfully about his counterpart, Xi Jinping, and moved to ease tensions in a wider trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Trump is expected to travel to India later this year for a Quad summit.

Both the Indian and Japanese foreign ministers said they wanted the Quad to focus on a “free and open Indo-Pacific” – a **phrasing** that is a **veiled** **allusion** to opposing Chinese dominance in Asia.

“It is **essential** that nations of the Indo-Pacific have the freedom of choice, so essential to make right decisions on development and security,” Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said.

At Jaishankar’s urging, the Quad also condemned a May attack on the Indian side of Kashmir that killed mostly Hindu civilians and called for “the **perpetrators**, organisers and financiers of this **reprehensible** act to be brought to justice without any delay”.

In a key concern for Japan, the Quad condemned North Korea for its “destabilising launches” of missiles and insisted on its “complete **denuclearisation**”.

Despite common ground on China, Quad members have differed on other hotspots, with the joint statement not mentioning Ukraine or Iran.

India has maintained its long relationship with Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine, while both India and Japan also have historically enjoyed **cordial** ties with Iran.

#### [2025-07-02 ‘A billion people backing you’: China transfixed as Musk turns against Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/02/a-billion-people-backing-you-china-transfixed-as-musk-turns-against-trump)

Few **break-ups** have as many **gossiping** observers as the fallout between the once **inseparable** Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

The ill-fated bromance between the US president and the world’s richest man, which once raised questions about American **oligarchy**, is now being **pored** over by social media users in China, many of whom are Team Musk.

The latest drama comes from Musk’s pledge to found a new political party, the America party, if Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill, which Musk described as “insane” passed the Senate this week (it did). Musk had already vowed to unseat lawmakers who backed Trump’s **flagship** piece of legislation, which is expected to increase US national debt by $3.3tn.

On Wednesday, hours after the bill passed the US Senate, the hashtag #MuskWantsToBuildAnAmericaParty went viral on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform similar to Musk’s X, receiving more than 37m views.

“If Elon Musk were to found a political party, his tech-driven mindset could inject fresh energy into politics. The potential for change is significant – and worth watching,” wrote one Weibo user.

“When you’ve had enough, there’s no need to keep putting up with it,” wrote another.

One comment **summed up** the mood on the platform: “Brother Musk, you’ve got over a billion people on our side backing you.”

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is widely **venerated** in China for his business **acumen** and technological achievements. Tesla’s electric vehicles are the only western brand on Chinese roads that can rival domestic firms, and the company’s biggest factory by volume is in Shanghai. Musk is known to have a close relationship with China’s premier, Li Qiang, while Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, is a social media celebrity **in her own right** in China.

Musk’s popularity in China follows a well-established trend of Chinese audiences **enthusiastically** embracing US tech innovators. Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs was a bestseller in China, as was his biography of Musk.

Trump, however, is seen by many as being an unpredictable funnyman who has launched the most **aggressive** trade war on China in recent history.

Some internet users commented that Trump and Musk should grow up. “These two grown men argue **nonstop** over the smallest things – and the whole world ends up knowing about it,” wrote one user, while another joked: “Every day, Musk is basically live-streaming ‘How Billionaires Argue’”.

The conversation has been allowed to **flourish** on China’s tightly controlled social media, suggesting that at least some censors are betting that the US political chaos could be no bad thing for China.

#### [2025-07-02 US halts weapons shipments to Ukraine over fears stockpiles are too low](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/02/us-halts-ukraine-weapons-shipments)

The US is halting some shipments of weapons to Ukraine amid concerns that its own stockpiles have declined too much, officials said Tuesday, a setback for the country as it tries to fend off escalating attacks from Russia.

Certain munitions were previously promised to Ukraine under the Biden administration to aid its defences during the more than three-year-old war. The pause reflects a new set of priorities under President Donald Trump and came after defence department officials scrutinised US stockpiles and raised concerns.

“This decision was made to put America’s interests first following a review of our nation’s military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. “The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains **unquestioned** – just ask Iran.”

That was a reference to Trump recently ordering US missile strikes against nuclear sites in Iran.

The Pentagon review determined that stocks were too low on some weapons previously pledged, so pending shipments of some items won’t be sent, according to a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide information that has not yet been made public.

The defence department did not provide details on what specific weapons were being **held back**.

“America’s military has never been more ready and more capable,” spokesperson Sean Parnell said, adding that the major tax cut and spending package moving through Congress “ensures that our weapons and defence systems are modernised to protect against 21st century threats for **generations to come**.”

The halt of some weapons from the US is a blow to Ukraine as Russia has recently launched some of its biggest aerial attacks of the war, in an escalating bombing campaign that has further **dashed** hopes for a breakthrough in peace efforts **championed** by Trump. Talks between the sides have ground to a halt.

The US **stoppage** was first reported by Politico.

**To date**, the US has provided Ukraine more than $66bn worth of weapons and military assistance since Russia invaded its neighbour in February 2022.

Over the course of the war, the US has routinely pressed for allies to provide air defence systems to Ukraine. But many are reluctant to give up the hi-tech systems, particularly countries in eastern Europe that also feel threatened by Russia.

Trump met with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Nato summit last week and had left open the possibility of sending Kyiv more US-made Patriot air defence missile systems, acknowledging they would help the Ukrainian cause.

“They do want to have the antimissile missiles, OK, as they call them, the Patriots,” Trump said then. “And we’re going to see if we can make some available. We need them, too. We’re supplying them to Israel, and they’re very effective, 100% effective. Hard to believe how effective. They do want that more than any other thing.”

Those comments reflect a change of thinking about providing weapons to Ukraine across the administration in recent months.

In **testimony** before lawmakers in June, defence secretary Pete Hegseth said he had moved quickly to **quash** wasteful programmes and redirect funding to Trump’s top objectives.

Hegseth said a negotiated peace between Russia and Ukraine, which has been promoted for months by Trump, makes America look strong, even though Moscow is the aggressor in the conflict. He also said the defence budget includes hard choices and “reflects the reality that Europe needs to step up more for the defence of its own continent. And President Trump **deserves** the **credit** for that.”

The defense secretary told lawmakers last month that some US security spending for Ukraine was still in the **pipeline**, without providing details. But he said such assistance – which has been robust for the past two years – would be reduced.

#### [2025-07-02 Dalai Lama defies China to say successor will be chosen by Tibetan tradition](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/02/dalai-lama-says-there-will-be-search-for-his-successor-ending-years-of-speculation)

The Dalai Lama has declared in a direct challenge to China that the **centuries-old** spiritual institution bearing his name will continue after his death and that only his inner circle, not Beijing, will have the authority to identify his successor.

In a video message played on Wednesday during prayer celebrations ahead of his 90th birthday this weekend, the 14th Dalai Lama said the Gaden Phodrang Trust, which manages his affairs, would oversee the search for his **reincarnation**.

“No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,” he said in Dharamshala, the northern Indian hill town that serves as the seat of the Tibetan government in exile. “In accordance with past tradition, the search for my reincarnation and the naming of a 15th Dalai Lama will be carried out.”

The Dalai Lama had previously hinted he might be the last in the line, but he said consultations with senior spiritual leaders and appeals from the Tibetan public, including in Chinese-ruled Tibet, had persuaded him otherwise.

“In accordance with all these requests, I am affirming that the **institution** of the Dalai Lama will continue,” he told the gathering of senior Buddhist monks. He said clear written instructions would be left behind, but did not **elaborate** on their contents.

China annexed Tibet in 1951 and has retained tight control over the region ever since. It has said the choice of the next Dalai Lama lies only with Beijing, and has **enshrined** state **assent** for all senior Tibetan religious leaders in law. It insists the golden **urn** – a Qing dynasty **ritual** in which names are drawn by lot from a ceremonial vessel – is the only legitimate method for recognising reincarnated lamas. The Communist party must approve the final selection.

Beijing has already used this approach to assert control. After the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, Tibet’s second-highest spiritual authority, in 1995, the Dalai Lama recognised a six-year-old boy as his reincarnation. The boy and his family vanished into Chinese **custody** days later and have not been seen since. China **installed** its own candidate, widely rejected by Tibetans. According to Chinese state media, the Beijing-backed Panchen Lama met President Xi Jinping just last month and pledged loyalty to the Communist party.

The Dalai Lama has said his successor will be born in a free country, raising the possibility that the next reincarnation could emerge from among the Tibetan diaspora, which numbers about 140,000 globally, half of them in India. He has also said the next Dalai Lama might be an adult and not necessarily male.

“Today’s message is that the Dalai Lama institution will continue,” Lobsang Tenzin, the trust’s second-most senior leader and known by his religious title Samdhong Rinpoche, told a news conference in Dharamshala. “There will be a 15th Dalai Lama. There will be a 16th.” He said the Dalai Lama would issue detailed instructions on how the search for the next reincarnation should proceed.

Beijing swiftly rejected the Dalai Lama’s statement. “The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and other great Buddhist figures must be chosen by drawing lots from a golden urn and approved by the central government,” said the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning.

“Tibetan Buddhism was born in China and is a religion with Chinese characteristics,” she told a news briefing.

The clash underscores a long-running power struggle between Beijing and the Dalai Lama over who controls Tibetan Buddhism’s most sacred office. Most Tibetan Buddhists, in Tibet and in exile, oppose China’s tight control of the region.

Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama is the **earthly** **manifestation** of Avalokiteshvara, a **revered** figure in Buddhism known as the **bodhisattva** of **compassion** – a spiritual being who remains in the world to guide others on the path to **enlightenment**.

By tradition, only the current Dalai Lama, or those he appoints, can identify his successor, using visions, **omens** and consultation with senior lamas and protectors of the faith.

Tenzin Gyatso was recognised the 14th reincarnation at the age of two. He assumed full authority at 15 and fled Tibet four years later when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, in 1959. He has been living in exile in Dharamshala since.

He was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1989 “for advocating peaceful solutions based upon tolerance and mutual respect”.He wrote in a recent book: “The purpose of a reincarnation is to carry on the work of the predecessor. The new Dalai Lama will be born in the free world.”

The deputy speaker of the Tibetan parliament in exile, Dolma Tsering Teykhang, said: “The world needs to hear directly from His Holiness. China tries to **vilify** him at every chance … It is trying to frame rules and regulations on how to have the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in their hand.”

The succession dispute has also sharpened tensions between China and India, which granted asylum to the Dalai Lama after he fled Tibet. More than 100,000 Tibetans live in exile in India. Delhi officially recognises Tibet as part of China, but it also allows the Tibetan government in exile to operate from Dharamshala.

The reincarnation issue has drawn global attention. The US passed the Tibetan Policy and Support Act in 2020, threatening sanctions on Chinese officials who interfere in the selection process. The EU has voiced support for religious freedom in Tibet, but it has stopped short of taking a formal position on reincarnation.

#### [2025-07-04 Hong Kong code of conduct will oblige legislators to ‘sincerely support’ Beijing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/04/hong-kong-code-of-conduct-sincerely-support-beijing)

A new **code** of conduct in Hong Kong will require legislators to “sincerely support” Beijing’s jurisdiction on the city and the chief executive, and **prohibits** anything that might “vilify” the government.

The proposal for the new code, introduced on Wednesday, included **tiered** penalties for legislators who breach the code, including **suspension** without payment for the most serious offences.

It **stipulated** that legislators must “sincerely support the central government’s overall jurisdiction while securing the Hong Kong SAR’s special administrative region’s high degree of autonomy”, as well as the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong”, referring to election reforms which ensure that only pro-Beijing candidates can run.

“They should not intentionally vilify the governance credibility of the chief executive and the SAR government, nor should they deliberately undermine or weaken the effectiveness of executive-led governance,” it said.

The president of the legislative council of Hong Kong, Andrew Leung, told media the new rules wouldn’t restrict legislators from speaking up, but they must be careful to “not cross the red line”, Hong Kong Free Press reported.

Hong Kong’s governance system has undergone major **overhauls** in recent years, after a crackdown on the city’s pro-democracy movement and politicians saw major interventions by the government in Beijing.

Every major democratic party has **disbanded** or begun the process of disbandment, and thousands of people – including politicians and activists – have been prosecuted under national security laws.

A separate proposal this week flags new prison rules which include only allowing visits pre-approved by the **correctional** services department, would empower the department to consider restrictions on **clergy** visits, and seek rulings to bar visits by specific legal representatives to imprisoned clients.

“In the past, some people have abused the visiting mechanism and conducted visits in the name of ‘humanitarian support’,” said the amendment proposal. “In fact, they are using soft means to influence prisoners, intending to incite them to resist the **supervision** of the correctional services department, **arouse** their hatred towards the central government and the SAR government, and even make them become potential risks to national security and public safety after returning to society.”

The crackdown on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy population has been widely criticised by human rights and legal groups. Senior foreign judges have left or resigned from Hong Kong’s **appeal court**, with several specifically citing concerns over the new environment. Hong Kong authorities reject the claims.

In an interview published by an academic journal this week, the UK’s Brenda Marjorie Hale, who quietly declined an offer to extend her post on the Hong Kong court in 2021, said she was now “all the more convinced that it was the right thing to do”.

“Because, as things have developed, the National Security Law has taken over the Basic Law,” she said, referring to Hong Kong’s mini constitution.

“Even though the foreign judges are not likely to be asked to sit on national security cases, they are being asked to give respectability to a system that despite the best efforts ... are not going to succeed.”

#### [2025-07-04 Japan walks line between recession and submission as it seeks to overcome Trump tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/04/japan-submission-recession-trump-tariffs)

It all seemed to be going so well. In April, Japan’s chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, sat opposite Donald Trump in the Oval Office after “positive and constructive” talks, **sporting** a Maga baseball cap and giving a thumbs up for the cameras.

Japan’s economic **revitalisation** minister drew criticism back home for the gesture, forcing him to insist there was “no political significance” behind it. But the backdrop to the offending photo was far more significant than the uncomfortable **optics**.

Akazawa’s trade delegation was in Washington to begin tariff negotiations with its American counterparts that officials in Tokyo were initially optimistic would end with Japan’s exemption from Trump’s most **egregious** protectionist **instincts**.

“A Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade,” Trump wrote on Truth Social after meeting Akazawa. “Big Progress!”

Eleven weeks and seven rounds of talks later, Japan and the US have reached an impasse, with Trump unleashing on his country’s most important ally in the Asia-Pacific the kind of **invective** he once reserved for China and the European Union: “They won’t take our RICE, and yet they have a massive rice shortage,” he wrote online, adding it showed “how **spoiled** countries have become”.

The friction is beginning to **seep** into other parts of the bilateral relationship, with Tokyo and Washington at odds, to varying degrees, on the cost of hosting American troops in Japan and recent attacks by the US and Israel on Iran.

**To add insult to injury**, the **chasm** that has opened up between Tokyo and Washington on trade came as the US agreed to slash reciprocal tariffs on Vietnamese imports from 46% to 20%.

Japan now has just days before the end of Trump’s 90-day pause on the imposition of punishing tariffs to pull off a breakthrough.

Much will depend on Akazawa’s ability to convince American negotiators to withdraw or reduce a 25% levy on Japanese cars imposed in April. That is on top of a possible rise in reciprocal duties on other Japanese goods to 24% from the current baseline of 10%.

But if anything, the **mood music** from Washington indicates that Trump is even less inclined to make **concessions** ahead of the president’s second tariff “liberation day”, despite constant reminders from senior politicians in Tokyo of the value Japan brings to the US economy.

They include the prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, who noted this week that Japan is the largest foreign investor in the US and its biggest contributor in terms of job creation. “Our hope is that this will be taken into consideration,” he said.

Just days earlier, Trump had framed Japan in terms that prompted as much **consternation** as anger on this side of the Pacific.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, he floated the idea of raising tariffs on imports from Japan to 30% or 35%, and **bemoaned** its consumers’ lack of enthusiasm for American cars and rice.

“I’m not sure we’re going to make a deal. I doubt it,” Trump said, labelling Japan “very tough” and “very spoiled”.

Japan has much to lose if it fails to secure an extension to the deadline on reciprocal tariffs or convince the US to lower duties. The US is Japan’s second-biggest trading partner after China, with exports to the US totalling $148.2bn last year.

Trade between the two countries was worth an estimated $227.9bn last year, while the autos sector is already suffering from existing tariffs, with exports to the US dropping 25% in May compared to a year ago.

That will not put the brakes on Trump’s mission to **hack away** at Japan’s $68bn trade **surplus** with the US – hence his recent demands that it increase imports of US oil and other goods.

The **trade row** has landed Ishiba and his government in a predicament every bit as sticky as the early-summer heat and humidity **blanketing** Japan.

**Battered** by funding scandals, soaring rice prices and a cost-of-living crisis, Ishiba’s administration is **limping** into the campaign for upper house elections on 20 July, nine months after his Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner lost their majority in the lower house.

Any **inkling** that Tokyo is prepared to bend to Trump’s demands will not go down well with voters, while analysts warn that the economic impact of accepting higher tariffs could push the Japanese economy – the world’s fifth biggest – into recession.

Japan’s rice crisis has also become a point of **contention**, as the government attempts to bring down prices with the release of almost all of its 1m tonnes of stockpiled grain, along with a rise in cheaper imports.

Japan has imported historically high volumes of US rice in recent months, and yet despite Trump’s threats, is reluctant to agree to anything that would ignite anger among rice farmers – a politically influential group in the LDP.

Washington is also pressuring Japan to boost imports of other US farm products, as well as cars and oil, to help reduce the trade deficit.

Japan has declined to comment on Trump’s threat to impose even higher tariffs, saying it would pursue “sincere” bilateral talks. “We are aware of what President Trump said, but we don’t comment on every remark made by US government officials,” the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Kazuhiko Aoki, said this week

“We intend to advance bilateral talks in a sincere and **faithful** manner toward reaching an agreement that will benefit both Japan and the United States.”

Tariffs, though, are putting **strain** on what the former US ambassador to Tokyo, Mike Mansfield, once described as the “most important bilateral relationship in the world, **bar none**”.

After failing to make progress with Trump during a meeting at the G7 in Canada last month, Ishiba abruptly cancelled plans to attend the Nato summit in The Hague – a move analysts attributed to ongoing friction over trade.

Japan also declined to offer **full-throated** support for the US attacks on Iran, saying only that it “understood” Washington’s determination to halt Tehran’s nuclear weapons programme.

This week, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, **called off** his first visit to Japan and South Korea, saying he was needed in Washington for talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Amid rumours that he is preparing to make yet another trip to Washington this weekend, Akazawa has limited room for **manoeuvre** – and precious little time, according to analysts.

“Practical and **electoral** constraints will prevent Japan from offering major concessions on autos, rice, and oil, with negotiators set to continue their slow-and-steady approach,” said James Brady, vice-president of the political risk advisory firm Teneo.

“The probability of a deal being reached before next week’s tariff deadline appears increasingly low.”

#### [2025-07-06 Dalai Lama celebrates his 90th birthday, triggering geopolitical questions for the future](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/06/dalai-lama-celebrates-his-90th-birthday-triggering-geopolitical-questions-for-the-future)

Leaders from India, the United States and Taiwan offered their support to Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, on his 90th birthday on Sunday, a landmark anniversary raising geopolitical questions for the future.

Tibetans fear China will eventually name a rival successor to the Dalai Lama, bolstering Beijing’s control over Tibet, the territory it poured troops into in 1950 and has ruled ever since.

The man who calls himself a “simple Buddhist monk” celebrated in India, where he has lived since he and thousands of other Tibetans fled Chinese troops who crushed an uprising in their capital, Lhasa, in 1959.

The Dalai Lama says only his India-based office has the right to identify his eventual successor.

“I join 1.4 billion Indians in extending our warmest wishes to His Holiness the Dalai Lama on his 90th birthday,” the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said in a statement, read at celebrations in the Himalayan hill town where the Dalai Lama lives.

“He has been an **enduring** symbol of love, compassion, patience and moral discipline,” he added.

China insisted on Wednesday that it would have the final say on who succeeds the Tibetan spiritual leader.

Modi’s **effusive** support is significant.

India and China are intense rivals competing for influence across south Asia, but have sought to repair ties after a 2020 border clash.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, also said in a statement, read at the celebrations in India, that Washington was “committed to promoting respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Tibetans”.

“We support efforts to preserve Tibetans’ **distinct** **linguistic**, cultural and religious **heritage**, including their ability to freely choose and venerate religious leaders without interference,” the statement added.

Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te – who leads an island that China says is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to seize – said in a statement read at the ceremony that the example set by the Dalai Lama “**resonates** with all who **cherish** freedom, democracy and respect for human rights”.

Messages from three former US presidents were also broadcast.

“At a time when we see the forces of division tearing at the **fabric** of our common humanity … I’m grateful for your enduring efforts to build a better, kinder, more compassionate world,” Bill Clinton said.

“The world is a troubled place, and we need your spirit of kindness and compassion and love more than ever,” George W Bush added.

Barack Obama wished a “very happy birthday to the youngest 90-year-old I know”.

“It is humbling to realise that you’ve been a leader on the world stage for longer than I’ve been alive,” Obama said, in his message to his “dear friend”.

“You’ve shown generations what it means to practise compassion, and speak up for freedom and dignity,” Obama added. “Not bad for someone who describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk.”

#### [2025-07-07 Is Trump tariff deal really a win for Vietnam – or a way of punishing China?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/vietnam-trump-tariff-deal)

As news spread that Vietnam would become just the second nation to reach an initial tariff agreement with Washington, shares in the clothing companies and manufacturers that have a large footprint in the country rose with optimism.

Just hours later though, they declined sharply, as it became clear that the **devil** would be in the detail, and the most **striking** part of the deal might in fact be aimed at Vietnam’s powerful neighbour China.

Dodging the severe levy of 46% that was threatened in April, Vietnam is instead facing a tariff of 20% for many goods, and in return US products coming into the country will have zero tariffs placed on them.

However, a 40% tariff will remain for so-called **transshipments** – a **provision** that is aimed at Chinese companies accused of passing their products through Vietnam, or elsewhere, to avoid US tariffs.

Businesses worry that “transshipment” is a politicised term, and that if the US defines it too broadly, many goods could be unfairly targeted.

“Vietnam is a manufacturing hub – and as a hub you take inputs from other countries and make value-added stuff in Vietnam, and then export it to other countries,” says Dr Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.

It is unrealistic, he adds, to expect most Vietnamese goods, other than agricultural products, would be made entirely in Vietnam. What remains to be decided is: what proportion of a product should be?

How transshipments will be defined under the agreement – and how this policy will be enforced – remains to be seen, but it could have significant implications for global trade and tensions with China.

“One lesson for other countries is that the US intends to use these deals to apply pressure on China,” said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator.

Vietnam, a booming manufacturing hub, benefited during the last Trump administration when punishing tariffs placed on China prompted many Chinese companies to shift their supply chains.

However, this caused the Vietnamese **trade surplus** with the US to surge, attracting US **ire** and allegations that Vietnam was wrongly acting as a **conduit** for Chinese companies wanting access to the US market.

China’s commerce ministry spokesperson He Yongqian responded to the US-Vietnam deal on Thursday stating: “We firmly oppose any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests. If such a situation occurs, China will resolutely counter it to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”

Vietnam’s manufacturing industry is closely **intertwined** with both the US and China. US exports account for 30% of Vietnam’s GDP, while China is Vietnam’s top import source, relied on for raw materials used to make anything from **footwear** to furniture and electronics.

Vietnam is not alone in relying on China for such components, especially across electronic sectors. “China is completely **interwoven** into global supply chains,” says Dan Martin, international business adviser at Dezan Shira and Associates, based in Hanoi.

If companies are expected to prove the origin of all goods, this could place an unwelcome burden on those in sectors such as **textiles** where margins are low, says Martin.

However, he cautions that it remains to be seen whether the higher 40% tariff on transshipments will be actively enforced. It is also possible that Vietnam could benefit if US policy encourages suppliers to set up shop in Vietnam, Martin adds.

Businesses are largely pausing decisions until a clearer **picture** emerges, say analysts.

Policymakers in Hanoi remain on a diplomatic tightrope. Vietnam has long sought to balance relations with Washington and Beijing. It considers the US not only a key export market but a security partner that serves as a counterbalance to China’s **assertiveness**.

However, if Beijing considers that Hanoi is helping Washington constrain it, this risks **antagonising** Vietnam’s northern neighbour. It could lead to economic measures from China, or pressure over the disputed South China Sea, a major flashpoint in the region, says Peter Mumford, head of practice for south-east Asia at Eurasia Group.

As things stand, “aggressive retaliation” by Beijing against Hanoi is unlikely, he says: “Hanoi may even have given Beijing a rough indication of the steps it would have to take to secure a US trade deal.”

Vietnam has made efforts to show goodwill towards China over recent months, while also **courting** Trump.

In exchange for the 20% tariff rate, Trump said Vietnam would open up its market to US goods. US-made SUVs, “which do so well in the United States, will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam”, said Trump.

However the market for cars remains small in Vietnam, where city streets are famously **crammed** with millions of motorbikes.

#### [2025-07-07 China’s human rights lawyers speak out, 10 years after crackdown](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/chinas-human-rights-lawyers-speak-out-10-years-after-crackdown)

A decade on from China’s biggest crackdown on human rights lawyers in modern history, lawyers and activists say that the Chinese Communist party’s control over the legal **profession** has tightened, making rights defence work next to impossible.

The environment for human rights law has “steadily **regressed**, especially after the pandemic”, said Ren Quanniu, a **disbarred** human rights lawyer. “Right now, the rule of law in China – especially in terms of protecting human rights – has deteriorated to a point where it’s almost comparable to the Cultural Revolution era.” The Cultural Revolution was a decade of mass chaos unleashed by China’s former leader Mao Zedong in 1966. During that time judicial organs were attacked as “**bourgeois**” and the **nascent** court system was largely suspended.

Ren is one of hundreds of human rights lawyers to have been targeted since the “709 incident”, a nationwide crackdown on lawyers and activists that started on 9 July 2015. According to human rights groups and the US government, about 300 people from the loose collective of a **burgeoning** rights defence movement, known as weiquan, were targeted in the **round-up**. At least 10 were convicted of crimes such as “subversion of state power” and given jail terms, while dozens more have been subjected to **surveillance**, harassment and the revocation of their professional licences in the years since.

Modern China has never welcomed human rights lawyers. But in the relatively open years of the early 2000s, with the rise of the internet and China’s increasing desire for approval on the world stage, the space for civil society grew to a degree that is now almost unrecognisable. Lawyers scored wins for defendants in cases ranging from **tainted** baby milk formula scandals to the abuse of migrant workers.

“It’s hard to say we achieved success – we can only say that the services we provided have made it more difficult for the authorities to **persecute** certain groups,” said Jiang Tianyong, a 54-year-old former human rights lawyer known for taking on cases involving religious and ethnic minorities who served two years in prison for “inciting subversion of state power”.

But the nascent movement that Jiang was part of was suppressed soon after Xi Jinping, China’s leader, took power in 2012.

Although some weiquan lawyers were also interested in political reform, most were focused on working within the existing Chinese system. The **daily grind** was not about **promulgating** foreign ideas, said Ren. It was about defending ordinary citizens “based on the existing laws of China itself, the laws of the Chinese Communist party’s own legal system. Yet even within that framework, the lawyers were not allowed to help.”

Under Xi’s rule, activists have been rounded up, independent law firms and NGOs have been **reined** in, and any kind of organised activity outside the **auspices** of the Communist party (CCP) has been tightly restricted.

“The Chinese government under Xi Jinping has sought to **eradicate** the influence of lawyers who defend people’s rights,” said Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch.

Ten years on from the crackdown, human rights workers say that the suppression of independent lawyers has become more systematic, and less visible, than rounding up individuals. Those affected by the 709 incident describe living under conditions of harassment and surveillance, and are often blocked from leaving the country. Jiang hasn’t seen his wife and daughter, who left China, in over a decade.

More broadly, lawyers working on cases that the CCP considers sensitive have been stripped of their professional credentials, while legal and political reforms have strengthened the role of the CCP in law firms.

Ren escaped the first wave of **reprisals** after the 709 incident. For a few years, he tried to keep on taking up sensitive cases, including that of Zhang Zhan, the citizen journalist who was jailed after reporting from Wuhan on the early days on the Covid-19 pandemic.

In 2021, his licence was revoked.

According to data gathered by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a US-based NGO, between 2017 and 2019, there were 29 cases of law firms or lawyers having their licences revoked or suspended, compared with nine cases between 2014 and 2016.

At the same time, China has expanded the provision of legal aid, which the government says will “benefit more people in need”. According to a Chinese study published in 2022, 60% of defendants with legal representation would receive government-sponsored legal aid. But the legal aid law states that its aim is to “uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist party” and critics say that the changes, which include the insertion of Xi Jinping Thought into the charter of the All-China Lawyers Association, have narrowed the space for independent lawyers.

“The Chinese government has been increasing ideological control throughout the legal profession while also increasing the provision of public legal services, and at the same time requiring those legal services be provided by lawyers who are loyal to the party,” said Wang.

Many of China’s human rights lawyers say their work has been pushed underground. Those without licences try to offer **informal** advice to people in need, but their ability is severely limited.

Under these conditions, “no one is truly safe,” said Xie Yanyi, a lawyer detained in the 709 crackdown. “Human rights belong to everyone, and the rule of law protects everyone.”

Still, Xie remains hopeful for the future. “Although the year of the 709 incident marked a major regression in the rule of law in China … people, I believe, are gradually building resilience, **maturing** and becoming stronger.”

China’s Ministry of Justice and Public Security Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.

#### [2025-07-08 Ukraine war briefing: US to resume shipments of weapons for Ukrainian defence](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/08/ukraine-war-briefing-sanctions-over-russian-chemical-weapons-on-battlefield)

Donald Trump said on Monday that the US would resume shipments of “defensive weapons, primarily” to Ukraine in a **reversal** of an only days-old decision to withhold their supply. Answering a reporter’s question at the White House, the US president said: “We’re going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves. They’re getting hit very hard now.”

The Pentagon under Pete Hegseth last week halted already funded and promised arms shipments to Ukraine, with the defence secretary and Trump administration officials giving varying reasons – ranging from a seriously questioned claim by Hegseth of low weapons stocks, to the pause being part of a standard review of defence capabilities.

Soon after Trump spoke on Monday, the Pentagon released a statement. “At President Trump’s direction, the department of defence is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops. Our framework for Potus to evaluate military shipments across the globe remains in effect and is **integral** to our America First defence priorities.”

Britain on Monday placed sanctions on two Russian individuals and one Russian entity for the transfer and use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. It imposed asset freezes and travel bans on Aleksey Viktorovich Rtishchev and Andrei Marchenko, the head and deputy head of Russia’s **radiological** chemical and biological defence troops. The Joint Stock Company Federal Scientific and Production Centre Scientific Research Institute of Applied Chemistry was sanctioned for supplying the Russian military with RG-Vo **riot** control **grenades** whose use in warfare **contravenes** the international chemical weapons convention.

At least one person was killed and 71 were wounded in Russian drone strikes on Ukraine’s second biggest city, Kharkiv, officials said on Monday. **Apartment** buildings, a kindergarten and the regional **draft** office were damaged in two waves of strikes, local and military officials said. During the second wave, six Shahed drones struck within 10 minutes, aimed “at residential streets, at cars, at people”, said the Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov.

In south-eastern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia city at least 20 people were wounded and dozens of residential buildings and a university building damaged in a morning drone strike, governor Ivan Fedorov said on Monday. One person was killed in Odesa, regional officials said.

Russia struck two military recruitment centres in drone attacks on Monday, Ukraine’s military said. The attacks hit densely populated areas, in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, damaging draft offices as well as wounding dozens of civilians, and came a day after a Russian drone struck a recruitment centre in Kremenchuk. Last week, Russian attacks targeted draft offices in Poltava, another regional capital, as well as Kryvyi Rih.

Ukraine’s national security and defence council said Russia was waging an “information campaign” on social media about draft office locations “to destabilise the mobilisation process and sow panic among the population”; however a ground forces spokesperson said recruitment remained on track.

Ukraine’s military said it struck a chemical plant in Russia’s Moscow region that manufactures explosives, ammunition and **thermobaric** warheads for Shahed attack drones. “A series of explosions were recorded in the area of the city of Krasnozavodsk and the movement of fire trucks in neighbouring settlements,” the military general staff announced on Monday.

Ukraine’s drones also hit workshops at the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia’s Krasnodar region, causing a fire and **disrupting production**, according to a Ukrainian security service source cited in national media. The BBC said it confirmed the information with its own security source, and Russian local officials confirmed the Krasnodar attack.

The former deputy chief of the Russian army’s general staff was sentenced to 17 years in prison on Monday over a scheme involving theft of money from defence ministry contracts, the Tass news agency of Russia reported. Khalil Arslanov, a **colonel** general, and others were found guilty of stealing 1.6bn roubles (£14.9m/US$20.3m) from state contracts with Voentelecom, which provides telecommunications services and equipment to the Russian military.
