#### [2025-03-16 US says airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen will continue indefinitely](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/16/us-says-airstrikes-against-houthis-in-yemen-will-continue-indefinitely)

US officials have said airstrikes launched against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis will continue **indefinitely**, after a first round on Saturday killed at least 53 people and injured almost 100 more.

```
This morning, our teacher told us the exam had beenput off indefinitely.
```

The strikes, which aim to punish the Houthis for their attacks against Red Sea shipping, are Donald Trump’s first such use of US **military might** in the region since he took power in January.

```
After decades of hard work, China's military might has made remarkable progress.
```

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, told Fox News: “The minute the Houthis say ‘we’ll stop shooting at your ships, we’ll stop shooting at your drones’, this campaign will end, but until then it will be **unrelenting**.”

```
Despite the agreement on a 30-day ceasefire, Russia's unrelenting drone attacks on Kyiv continue.
```

Hegseth was among several senior officials underlining that the strikes were **designed to** signal a new assertive approach to Iran, and more generally in the Middle East.

```
The experiments presented in class are designed to help students better understand.
```

Michael Waltz, the US national security adviser, said in separate interviews that the strikes “targeted multiple Houthi leaders and **took them out**” and had involved “overwhelming force [that] put Iran on notice that **enough is enough**”.

```
Uprisings throughout the country were aimed at taking the tyrant out.
```

```
After all that has happened, everyone realized that enough is enough.
```

Video posted by social media users suggested Trump had earlier in the day been at his Mar-a-Lago **resort** in Palm Beach and at the nearby Trump International golf club.

```
We had a good time at the resort last week.
```

In a statement shared by state media, Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the strikes on Yemen as a “**gross** violation of the principles of the United Nations charter and the fundamental rules of international law”.

```
What this man did was a gross violation of the law.
```

The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the US government had “no authority, or business, **dictating** Iranian foreign policy”.

```
You have no right to dictate to me what to do.
```

“The explosions were **violent** and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children,” said one resident, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia.

```
The thunder was so violent that it was heard by people throughout the city.
```

A **crane** and bulldozer were used to remove debris at one site in the city and people used their bare hands to pick through the rubble. At a hospital, medics treated the injured, including children, and the bodies of several **casualties** were placed in a yard, wrapped in plastic sheets, Reuters footage showed.

```
Several cranes have been mobilised to the rescue scene.
```

```
Not all of the casualties have been transferred out of the field.
```

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday called for “utmost restraint and a **cessation** of all military activities” in Yemen.

```
Among all sides, the cessation of violence is a consensus.
```

On Tuesday, the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, the **Bab al-Mandab** strait and the **Gulf of Aden**, ending a period of relative calm starting in January with the Gaza ceasefire.

```
The Bab al-Mandab Strait has an important strategic significance, which links the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
```

#### [2025-03-17 Donald Trump: Iran will be held responsible for Houthi attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/17/donald-trump-iran-will-be-held-responsible-for-houthi-attacks)

“Every **shot** fired by the Houthis will be **looked upon**, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be **held responsible**, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be **dire**!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Monday.

```
We have only 5 shots left.
```

```
He should be looked upon in the same way as the others.
```

```
Anyone who breaks the law will be held responsible.
```

```
What she faces is such a dire situation.
```

Trump’s comments further escalate his administration’s new **campaign** targeting the rebels. Airstrikes killed at least 53 people this weekend and appear **poised** to continue. Meanwhile, Iran continues to **weigh** how to respond to a letter Trump sent it last week trying to **jump-start** negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly **advancing** nuclear programme.

```
All of the soldiers were brave in the campaign.
```

```
He is poised to take the exam.
```

```
You should weigh how to gather so much money in just 3 days.
```

```
Due to its advancing industrial policies, China has achieved significant growth in the auto sector.  
```

Describing the Houthis as “sinister **mobsters** and **thugs**”, Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there”.

```
Mobsters and thugs have severely undermined the safety and security of the community.
```

“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim’ of **rogue** terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control,” Trump alleged in his post. 

```
This room will not tolerate rogue behavior.
```

It is unclear what sparked Trump’s post. However, the head of Iran’s **paramilitary** Revolutionary Guards sought to separate the Houthis’ actions from those of Tehran this weekend.

```
Both their equipment and fighting spirit are of a paramilitary nature.
```

#### [2025-03-18 Vladimir Putin agrees to 30-day halt to attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/trump-and-putin-to-hold-high-stakes-call-on-ukraine)

Vladimir Putin has agreed to a limited ceasefire that would stop Russia targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure after a **high-stakes** phone call with Donald Trump.

```
Investing in A-Shares can be considered a form of high-stakes gambling.
```

But the Russian leader declined to commit to a 30-day full ceasefire, a plan pitched by Trump that Ukraine agreed to last week, **denting** the US president’s hope of bringing a quick end to hostilities.

```
What he has done has dented my expectations for the celebration.
```

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking after the call, said Ukraine was **favourable** to the idea of both sides halting attacks on each other’s infrastructure but he was waiting for “details” of what had been agreed first.

```
Everyone is favourable to his achievements.
```

Trump put a positive **spin** on the discussion, writing on his Truth Social platform shortly after the call ended that he had had a “very good and **productive**” conversation with Putin.

```
The government mouthpiece put a rare positive spin on the event.
```

```
The meeting held in Beijing last month was quite productive.
```

“We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an **understanding** that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine,” he added.

```
They have come to an undertanding on the refugees.
```

If **upheld** by both sides, a halt to attacks on energy infrastructure would mark the first **partial** ceasefire in more than three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

```
The relationship should be upheld by both of us.
```

```
Partial ceasefire is acceptable.
```

In his first public appearance since the call, Trump told Fox News interviewer Laura Ingraham: “Right now you have a lot of guns pointing at each other and a ceasefire without going a little bit further would have been **tough**. Russia has the advantage. As you know, they have encircled about 2,500 soldiers. They are nicely encircled and that’s not good. And we want to **get it over with**.”

```
The tough experiences make him stronger.
```

```
Let's get it over with.
```

During the interview Trump described himself as a “**nationalist**” who has “very good” relationships with Putin, Chinese president Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un.

```
As a notionalist, he can't tolerate any words criticising his motherland.
```

That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of **Humanity**, get the job done!”

```
What we have done is simply out of humanity.
```

During the call with Trump, which lasted two and a half hours, Putin reiterated his concerns over **a range of** issues that he said must be addressed before a more wide-ranging ceasefire could be implemented, according to the Kremlin statement.

```
A range of achievements has been showcased at the exhibition.
```

The “series of significant issues” included how such a ceasefire would be **enforced** and whether it would give Ukraine an opportunity to strengthen its forces and receive western military aid, it said.

“It was emphasised that a key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working toward its resolution through political and diplomatic means must be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the **provision** of intelligence to Kyiv,” the Kremlin said.

```
Thanks for your provision of these books.
```

There was no indication that Putin had abandoned any of his most hardline objectives in the war in Ukraine. He told Trump that peace talks must “take into account the unconditional **necessity** to remove the initial reasons for the crisis and Russia’s legal security interests”.

```
Necessities of daily life have been promptly mobilised to the earthquake's epicenter.
```

Europe would be uneasy about a suspension of all weapons deliveries to Ukraine as the UK and EU are **stepping up efforts** to deliver fresh military aid packages to Kyiv as soon as possible.

```
We should join hands to step up efforts to achieve the Chinese Dream.
```

At a news conference in Berlin with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz, the **outgoing** German chancellor, called an end to Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure “a good start” but stressed that “there cannot be an agreement without Ukraine”.

```
An outgoing offical will gain less favor.
```

Before the call, Trump said Russian and American negotiators had already talked about “**dividing up** certain **assets**”.

```
His sons have already divided up this assets.
```

Washington is also reportedly discussing the possibility of putting pressure on the UN to **follow suit**, it said.

```
I'm so glad that you decided to follow suit.
```

“It is **official** now – a PERFECT call,” Kirill Dmitriev, a senior aide close to Putin, wrote on X.

```
As the official explantations always avoided certain issues, a trust crisis has formed.
```

#### [2025-03-19 Trump and Zelenskyy share ‘frank’ but ‘very good’ call as Ukraine accepts partial ceasefire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/19/trump-has-very-good-phone-call-with-zelenskyy-who-signs-on-to-partial-ceasefire)

Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a “very good telephone call” on Wednesday, according to Trump, in the first conversation between the US president and his Ukrainian counterpart since their disastrous **showdown** in the White House three weeks ago.

```
Showdown means you don't have chance any more.
```

Zelenskyy described the call as “positive, very **substantive** and frank”, and said he had signed up to a partial ceasefire that Trump agreed with Vladimir Putin a day earlier. The White House said Trump had promised to help with a Ukrainian request to source more air defence **batteries** for Kyiv.

```
The conversation made no progress, and deliberately, many subsetantive issues have been ignored.
```

```
Several air defence batteries have been introduced to tackle drone attacks.
```

The last encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy ended in an angry **exchange of words** between the two presidents and the US vice-president, JD Vance. It marked a low point in US-Ukrainian relations and **spooked** other allies that Washington may be about to abandon Kyiv.

```
It's no use engaging in an exchange of words.
```

```
The steep increase of interest rate spooks investment market.
```

We are very much on track,” he wrote, in language that was noticeably less **hyperbolic** than some of his **pronouncements** on the conflict.

```
His pronouncements are so hyperbolic that nobody believes.
```

Ukrainian officials say that they believe their relations with the Trump administration are now on **sounder** **footing**.

```
We will retreat to winterfall and get a sounder footing.
```

“It was a **fairly** **emotional** conversation in the Oval Office, and it showed that **contradictions** had built up,” said Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak, in an interview in Kyiv earlier on Wednesday.

```
His speech was fairly emotional.
```

```
Contradictions exist in all societies.
```

On Wednesday, Trump’s negotiating envoy Steve Witkoff described the call between Trump and Putin as “two great leaders coming together for the **betterment** of mankind”.

```
Each piece of work we did was committed to the betterment of people's lives.
```

“They believe that this softer rhetoric, many personal connections, will enable them to find a level of trust. Although when I put the words ‘trust’ and ‘Russia’ together, it looks **fantastical** to me,” he said.

```
I had a fantastical dream last night.
```

Trump, in an initial post on Truth Social, said the partial ceasefire would apply to “energy and infrastructure”, giving the impression that it would extend to all **civilian infrastructure**.

```
All civilian infrastructure needs to be maintained periodically.
```

However, Peskov directly **contradicted** Trump, when speaking to reporters in Moscow: “The need to halt arms supplies to Kyiv was discussed during Putin and Trump’s conversation,” he said.

```
The congress contradicted the proposal, which ignited people's rage.
```

#### [2025-03-20 EU ready to impose more sanctions on Russia after summit talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/20/eu-ready-to-impose-more-sanctions-on-russia-after-summit-talks)

EU leaders – apart from Hungary’s Viktor Orbán – say they are ready to increase pressure on Russia through further sanctions, as summit talks exposed a **geographical** divide on rearming Europe.

Meeting in Brussels, the bloc agreed it was ready to **levy** further sanctions on Russia and strengthen existing measures after talks with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who joined by video link.

The show of unity was **marred** by Orbán refusing to support an EU text declaring support for Ukraine, which stated: “The European Council calls on Russia to show real political will to end the war.” The Hungarian prime minister similarly declined to support the EU position two weeks ago.

Orbán’s growing confidence in diverging from the EU on Ukraine raises questions about the bloc’s ability to impose new sanctions and renew existing ones, although diplomats take **comfort** from the fact Hungary has always **acceded** to the plans in the end.

Zelenskyy told the EU leaders: “Please do not ease pressure on Russia over the war. Sanctions must remain in place until Russia starts withdrawing from our land and fully compensates for the damage caused by its aggression.”

In a clear reference to Hungary’s efforts to stymie Ukraine’s EU accession talks, Zelenskyy added, without naming any country: “It is simply anti-European when one person blocks decisions that are important for the entire continent or that have already been agreed upon.”

**Separately** the Financial Times reported that Europe’s biggest military powers are discussing how to take on greater responsibility for Europe’s defence. Countries including the UK, France and Germany aim to present Donald Trump with a plan to shift the financial and military **burden** to European capitals, in the hope of a managed transfer over five to 10 years, the paper reported.

Leaving the summit, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, praised the “Buy European” policy as a major doctrine change in Europe that would make the continent more independent. In a victory for Paris, the European Commission has proposed that a €150bn (£125bn) loans rearmament programme should exclude countries without a defence pact with the EU, such as the UK and the US.

Macron also said he would host a meeting of European leaders with Zelenskyy in Paris next Thursday to discuss Ukraine’s defence, including immediate military aid, making any ceasefire work and possibly deployment of troops.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said it was of the utmost importance to develop the defence industrial base in Europe, adding that “associated countries” could be involved. “These are billions and billions of **euros** that we will spend and we want a return on investment,” she said. “And where they are spent, they will produce good jobs.”

Meanwhile, Jens Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary general who last month re-entered the Norwegian government as finance minister, said that uncertainty over US commitment to the transatlantic alliance was not a reason to “give up Nato”, but a motivation for European countries and Canada to increase their contributions.

Stoltenberg said that whether or not the US decided to reduce its Nato contributions, it was crucial for other Nato members to “stand together” and “step up”.

“We need to all do what we can to ensure that Nato remains a strong alliance between North America and Europe that has helped to keep us safe for more than 75 years. There have been differences and disagreements before but we have been able to overcome them by realising we are all safer when we stand together,” he said, speaking from Copenhagen shortly before Zelenskyy **touched down** in Norway on Thursday.

“If the US should decide to reduce their contributions to Nato, it is even more important that we stand together the rest of us in Nato and step up, as European allies now do. And not least the United Kingdom, being the second largest military power in Nato after the United States.”

He added: “I cannot rule out that the US will reduce their contributions to the Nato command structures, to the Nato forces, but I expect the United States to remain a Nato ally. The answer to that is not to give up Nato but to strengthen the European and Canadian contributions to Nato.”

Despite an EU agreement to “urgently step up efforts” to aid Ukraine’s defence, a €40bn (£33bn) EU military aid plan has **fizzled** out after it failed to win support from larger member states, including France, Spain and Italy. Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy head, who led the initiative, is now calling on member states to provide 2m shells worth €5bn, a downgrade on her original plan that **envisaged** every country contributing military aid based on the size of its economy.

Kallas **acknowledged** the plan had not won universal support: “For every country it is the domestic politics, also the understanding of the public of what needs to be done and that is different in every member state.”

EU talks on an €800bn plan to ensure Europe can deter any potential invaders by 2030 are exposing the geographical fault lines over rearming Europe.

Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said the EU summit was about “finalising the first stage of perhaps the most important project in decades: making Europe safe, armed and united against the Russian threat”.

Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, said Europe was facing a strategic choice that recalled the years before the second world war. “We have to rearm ourselves because otherwise we will be the second, next victim of Russian aggression.”

Spain and Italy, which both spend below the 2% Nato target on defence, say Europe cannot **overlook** other threats to security. Spain is urging a wider definition of defence spending to **encompass** cybersecurity, anti-terrorism and efforts to combat the climate crisis.

Its prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he did not like the term “rearm”, which the European Commission has used repeatedly in its drive to increase defence spending. It was important, he said, “to take into account that the challenges that we face in the southern neighbourhood are a bit different to the ones the eastern **flank** face”.

Earlier this month the commission outlined an €800bn plan that included a €150bn loans package and flexibility on EU **fiscal** rules that would allow countries to take on €650bn in additional debt. EU leaders have endorsed the big picture, but some countries are **reluctant** to deepen their debts and are seeking EU grants.

The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said the EU needed “a more serious discussion” on “the provision of grants to European member states in order to make the important investments that they need to do”. The Netherlands and Germany oppose any common debt that would be used to create such grants.

Stoltenberg said it was “valid” and “fair” of Trump to ask other Nato members to do more, adding: “The good news is that Europeans are doing more.”

#### [2025-03-23 Gulf in US and Russian expectations marks start of latest ceasefire talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/23/gulf-in-us-and-russian-expectations-marks-start-of-latest-ceasefire-talks)

US and Ukrainian officials have met for further talks aimed at **hammering out** a ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine, with Washington signalling its hope for “real progress” even as Moscow warned that “difficult negotiations” lie ahead.

The **gulf** in expectations marked the start of the latest round of negotiations in Saudi Arabia, which was set to follow with a meeting between American officials and Russia on Monday. The US is pushing for a broad ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine by 20 April, according to Bloomberg, though sources said the timeline may **slip** given the wide **gap** that exists between Kyiv and Moscow’s positions.

On Sunday, the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, appeared upbeat about working with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since the second world war. “I feel that he wants peace,” Witkoff told Fox News.

This week’s talks are expected to **delve** into the details of implementing the 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure, and potentially expand into shipping in the Black Sea.

“I think you’re going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries,” said Witkoff. “And from that you’ll naturally **gravitate** to a **full-on** shooting ceasefire.”

Ukraine’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said after the meeting that the talks were “constructive”, adding that the energy sector was a key focus of the negotiations.

“The discussion was productive and focused – we addressed key points including energy,” he said on social media, adding Ukraine was working to make its goal of a “just and lasting peace” a reality.

Earlier on Sunday, the White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said that the US was also talking through a range of confidence-building measures, including the future of Ukrainian children taken into Russia.

The Kremlin, however, swiftly poured cold water on hopes for a rapid resolution, saying that “difficult negotiations” lie ahead. “We are only at the beginning of this path,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state TV on Sunday.

Peskov said the “main” focus in its talks with the US would be a possible **resumption** of a 2022 Black Sea grain deal, brokered by Turkey and the UN, that ensured safe navigation for Ukrainian farm exports via the Black Sea.

Moscow **pulled out of** the deal in 2023, amid accusations that the west had failed to uphold its commitments to ease sanctions on Russia’s exports of farm produce and **fertilisers**.

Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Witkoff, a real **estate** developer who had no prior diplomatic experience before being tasked as Donald Trump’s special envoy, downplayed fears of Vladimir Putin launching a broader aggression.

“I just don’t see that he wants to take all of Europe,” he said. “I take him at his word in this sense, so, and I think the Europeans are beginning to come to that belief, too. But it sort of doesn’t matter. That’s an academic issue … The agenda is, stop the killing, stop the **carnage**. Let’s end this thing.”

Last week Putin agreed to Trump’s proposal for a 30-day halt on attacks to energy infrastructure. The ceasefire, however, was cast into doubt soon after, with both sides reporting continued strikes.

Ukrainian officials said on Sunday that at least seven people were killed overnight after Russia launched 147 drones. Ukrainian air defences shot down 97 of the drones, and 25 others were hindered by Ukrainian countermeasures.

Three people, including a five-year-old child, were killed in Kyiv, while four people were killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine’s Donetsk region.

Russian troops reportedly seized the small village of Sribne in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, while Ukraine’s army said its troops had recaptured the small village of Nadia in the eastern Luhansk region.

Russian officials said Sunday that their air defences had destroyed 59 Ukrainian drones targeting the country’s southwestern regions, noting that the strikes had killed one person in Rostov.

This week’s talks **come on the heels of** a wide-ranging interview with the former Fox News host, Tucker Carlson, in which Witkoff detailed his **admiration** for Putin, who launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, and **scorned** the UK’s prime minister.

Witkoff said he “liked” the Russian president – “I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy … He’s super smart”, he said – while he dismissed Keir Starmer’s readiness to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine post-ceasefire as “a combination of a **posture** and a pose”.

Witkoff, who is leading the US ceasefire negotiations with both Russia and Ukraine, described Starmer’s idea as “**simplistic**” adding: “I think there’s this, you know, this sort of notion of we’ve all got to be like Winston Churchill, the Russians are gonna march across Europe. I think that’s **preposterous**. By the way, we have something called Nato that we did not have in World War II.”

Witkoff also asserted that Kyiv had “agreed” to hold elections[,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/ukraine-zelenskyy-says-trump-living-in-russian-disinformation-bubble) though he offered no further details or backing for the claim. Ukraine’s constitution bars national elections from being held during a period of martial law, while, logistically speaking, any **outcome** risks being marred by disruptions from air raids, potential attacks on crowded polling stations and the Russian occupation of some regions.

When asked about the upcoming talks, however, Witkoff said the “central issue” was the Ukrainian regions that had been annexed or partially occupied by Russian forces. He **stumbled**, however, in trying to name them.

“The largest issue in that conflict are these so-called four regions, Donbas, Crimea, you know the names and there are two others,” said Witkoff, in remarks that appeared to be an attempt to name Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson and that confused Crimea with one of the four occupied eastern territories.

Earlier this month, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine would not recognise any occupied territories – where Russia was accused of holding **sham** polls in 2022 in a bid to provide **cover** for their illegal annexation – as Russian.

Witkoff appeared to side with the Kremlin as he cited the largely discredited polls as evidence of local sentiment on the ground and **conflated** the locally spoken language with support for Russia.

“They’re Russian-speaking,” Witkoff said of the four eastern regions. “There have been **referendums** where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.”

In 2022, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors elections, said the referendums had not met international standards and had been held in areas where much of the population had fled and which were not secure, while there has been no evidence to suggest that Russian-speaking areas are more favourable to Russian rule.

Witkoff continued: “The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories? Can Zelenskyy survive politically if he acknowledges this?”

Witkoff, who met Putin earlier this month in Moscow, told Carlson that the meeting “got personal”, as Putin had commissioned “a beautiful **portrait**” of Trump from a “leading Russian artist” for Witkoff to take home to the US president.

Putin also told Witkoff of his reaction to the failed assassination attempt against Trump. “He went to his local church and met with his **priest** and prayed for the president – not because he was the president of the United States or could become the president of the United States – but because he had a friendship with him and he was praying for his friend,” said Witkoff.

“And I came home and delivered that message to our president and delivered the painting, and he was clearly touched by it,” he added.

His comments were swiftly slammed by the journalist and **historian** Anne Applebaum. “If you ever wondered how the KGB manipulated foreigners and got them to repeat Soviet propaganda, spend some time listening to Steve Witkoff talk about his wonderful conversations with Vladimir Putin,” she wrote on social media.

Witkoff went on to assert that the Russians had now obtained what they had hoped for when they launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose, exactly? They don’t need to absorb Ukraine,” he said. “They’ve gotten – they’ve reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea, and they’ve gotten what they want. So why do they need more?”

Instead he envisioned a global stage where the US and Russia could build on the ceasefire to normalise relations and join forces in areas such as energy policies in the Arctic, sea lanes, LNG supplies to Europe and artificial intelligence. “Who doesn’t want to have a world where Russia and the United States are doing, **collaboratively**, good things together?” he asked.
