#### [2025-03-16 US says airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen will continue indefinitely](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/16/us-says-airstrikes-against-houthis-in-yemen-will-continue-indefinitely)

US officials have said airstrikes launched against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis will continue **indefinitely**, after a first round on Saturday killed at least 53 people and injured almost 100 more.

The strikes, which aim to punish the Houthis for their attacks against Red Sea shipping, are Donald Trump’s first such use of US **military might** in the region since he took power in January.

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, told Fox News: “The minute the Houthis say ‘we’ll stop shooting at your ships, we’ll stop shooting at your drones’, this campaign will end, but until then it will be **unrelenting**.”

Hegseth was among several senior officials underlining that the strikes were **designed to** signal a new assertive approach to Iran, and more generally in the Middle East.

Michael Waltz, the US national security adviser, said in separate interviews that the strikes “targeted multiple Houthi leaders and **took them out**” and had involved “overwhelming force [that] put Iran on notice that **enough is enough**”.

Earlier, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: “To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON’T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!”

He added: “To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY!”

Official White House photos showed the president, wearing a Trump-branded golf shirt, watching the airstrikes on a display screen identified as being in Florida; video posted by social media users suggested Trump had earlier in the day been at his Mar-a-Lago **resort** in Palm Beach and at the nearby Trump International golf club.

On Sunday Anees Alsbahi, spokesperson for the Houthi-run health ministry, said five children and two women were among the 53 people killed in the US strikes. Another 98 people were injured, the ministry said.

The Houthis, an armed movement who have taken control of most of Yemen over the past decade, say they have targeted international shipping in solidarity with Palestinians and Hamas, which is also backed by Iran.

The Yemeni group has also launched missiles, drones and rockets at Israel since the beginning of the war in Gaza. Israeli officials said on Sunday they were investigating a missile launched from Yemen that landed in Egypt close to the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to check if it had been aimed at Israel.

Fighter aircraft shot down a combined 11 drones on Sunday fired by ​the Houthis, a US​ official told Reuters, following Houthi claims of an attempt to attack a US aircraft carrier off Yemen’s coast.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the drones did not come close to the Harry S Truman aircraft carrier, which has played a key role in Trump’s strikes on Yemen.

The top commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards responded to the US threats by saying the Houthis were independent and took their own strategic and operational decisions.

“We warn our enemies that Iran will respond decisively and destructively if they take their threats into action,” Maj Gen Hossein Salami told state media.

In a statement shared by state media, Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the strikes on Yemen as a “**gross** violation of the principles of the United Nations charter and the fundamental rules of international law”.

The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the US government had “no authority, or business, **dictating** Iranian foreign policy”. “End support for Israeli genocide and terrorism. Stop killing of Yemeni people,” he said in a post on X early on Sunday.

Washington has already increased sanctions pressure on Iran while trying to bring it to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme. A key question for regional observers is whether Trump may use military means against Tehran, possibly after pressure from Israel.

The US military’s central command, which oversees troops in the Middle East, described Saturday’s strikes as the start of a large-scale operation across Yemen. The strikes on Saturday were carried out in part by fighter aircraft from the Harry S Truman aircraft carrier, which is in the Red Sea. They could continue for weeks, one Pentagon official said.

The Houthis are seen as key actors in the “axis of resistance”, a loose regional coalition of militant groups built up by Iran over recent years to project force and put pressure on Israel.

The group is considered the only member of the coalition not to have been significantly weakened by Israel during the war in Gaza since October 2023 and the short conflict in Lebanon last year. Both Hamas and Hezbollah, once the most powerful member, have suffered significant losses.

The Houthis’ political bureau described the attacks as a “war crime”. “Our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation,” it said in a statement.

Residents in Sana’a said the strikes hit a neighbourhood known to host several members of the Houthi leadership.

“The explosions were **violent** and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children,” said one resident, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia.

A **crane** and bulldozer were used to remove debris at one site in the city and people used their bare hands to pick through the rubble. At a hospital, medics treated the injured, including children, and the bodies of several **casualties** were placed in a yard, wrapped in plastic sheets, Reuters footage showed.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday called for “utmost restraint and a **cessation** of all military activities” in Yemen. A new escalation could “fuel cycles of retaliation that may further destabilise Yemen and the region, and pose grave risks to the already dire humanitarian situation in the country”, his spokesperson said in a statement.

The previous administration in Washington, under Joe Biden, had sought to degrade the Houthis’ ability to attack vessels off Yemen’s coast but had limited US actions.

On Tuesday, the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, the **Bab al-Mandab** strait and the **Gulf of Aden**, ending a period of relative calm starting in January with the Gaza ceasefire.

A Pentagon spokesperson said the Houthis had attacked US warships 174 times and commercial vessels 145 times since 2023.

#### [2025-03-17 Donald Trump: Iran will be held responsible for Houthi attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/17/donald-trump-iran-will-be-held-responsible-for-houthi-attacks)

The US president, Donald Trump, has declared he will hold Iran directly responsible for any future attacks by Yemen’s Tehran-backed Houthi rebels, who have targeted US and other foreign ships in the Red Sea.

“Every **shot** fired by the Houthis will be **looked upon**, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be **held responsible**, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be **dire**!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Monday.

Trump’s comments further escalate his administration’s new **campaign** targeting the rebels. Airstrikes killed at least 53 people this weekend and appear **poised** to continue. Meanwhile, Iran continues to **weigh** how to respond to a letter Trump sent it last week trying to **jump-start** negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly **advancing** nuclear programme.

Describing the Houthis as “sinister **mobsters** and **thugs**”, Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there”.

“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim’ of **rogue** terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control,” Trump alleged in his post. “They’re dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, ‘Intelligence.’”

It is unclear what sparked Trump’s post. However, the head of Iran’s **paramilitary** Revolutionary Guards sought to separate the Houthis’ actions from those of Tehran this weekend. The Houthis also launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though none reached the ship as it continues flight operations in the region.

Iran did not immediately comment on the post.

#### [2025-03-18 Vladimir Putin agrees to 30-day halt to attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/trump-and-putin-to-hold-high-stakes-call-on-ukraine)

Vladimir Putin has agreed to a limited ceasefire that would stop Russia targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure after a **high-stakes** phone call with Donald Trump.

But the Russian leader declined to commit to a 30-day full ceasefire, a plan pitched by Trump that Ukraine agreed to last week, **denting** the US president’s hope of bringing a quick end to hostilities. The Kremlin said Putin demanded that the west halt all military aid to Kyiv before it could implement such a plan.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking after the call, said Ukraine was **favourable** to the idea of both sides halting attacks on each other’s infrastructure but he was waiting for “details” of what had been agreed first.

Trump put a positive **spin** on the discussion, writing on his Truth Social platform shortly after the call ended that he had had a “very good and **productive**” conversation with Putin.

“We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an **understanding** that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine,” he added.

A Kremlin statement said Putin had issued an order to the Russian military to suspend strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Within hours of the call ending, however, air raid alerts sounded in Kyiv, followed quickly by fresh explosions as Ukrainian air defence targeted Russian drones around the capital.

A few hours later, Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram that Russia had launched more than 40 drones against civilian infrastructure, including a hit on a hospital in the city of Sumy.

“In many regions we can exactly hear what it is that Russia wants,” wrote Zelenskyy.

In a briefing with journalists, Zelenskyy said he was waiting for further information from Washington.

“I think it will be right that we will have a conversation with President Trump and we will know in detail what the Russians offered the Americans or what the Americans offered the Russians,” he said.

“After we get details from the American president, from the American side, we will give our answer, prepare it, and our team will be ready for technical discussions.”

If **upheld** by both sides, a halt to attacks on energy infrastructure would mark the first **partial** ceasefire in more than three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Russia has been relentlessly targeting Ukraine’s infrastructure for the past three years, while in recent months Ukraine has been increasingly able to hit targets deep inside Russia with long-range drones.

In his first public appearance since the call, Trump told Fox News interviewer Laura Ingraham: “Right now you have a lot of guns pointing at each other and a ceasefire without going a little bit further would have been **tough**. Russia has the advantage. As you know, they have encircled about 2,500 soldiers. They are nicely encircled and that’s not good. And we want to **get it over with**.”

Asked by Ingraham about Russian media reports that Putin demanded an immediate cessation of aid to Ukraine in order to get to a deal, the president insisted: “No, we didn’t talk about aid, actually, we didn’t talk about aid at all. We talked about a lot of things but aid was never discussed.”

During the interview Trump described himself as a “**nationalist**” who has “very good” relationships with Putin, Chinese president Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un.

In his earlier statement, Trump said: “Many elements of a Contract for Peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end. That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of **Humanity**, get the job done!”

A White House statement said Washington and Moscow had also agreed to begin negotiations on the “implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace”. It said these negotiations would begin “immediately” in the Middle East.

During the call with Trump, which lasted two and a half hours, Putin reiterated his concerns over **a range of** issues that he said must be addressed before a more wide-ranging ceasefire could be implemented, according to the Kremlin statement.

The “series of significant issues” included how such a ceasefire would be **enforced** and whether it would give Ukraine an opportunity to strengthen its forces and receive western military aid, it said.

The Kremlin’s account of the call said Putin set several maximalist conditions for a lasting ceasefire, including the suspension of western arms and intelligence support for Ukraine. Putin also demanded that Ukraine halt the mobilisation of new recruits.

“It was emphasised that a key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working toward its resolution through political and diplomatic means must be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the **provision** of intelligence to Kyiv,” the Kremlin said.

There was no indication that Putin had abandoned any of his most hardline objectives in the war in Ukraine. He told Trump that peace talks must “take into account the unconditional **necessity** to remove the initial reasons for the crisis and Russia’s legal security interests”.

In recent statements Putin outlined these demands, which include a commitment to keeping Kyiv out of Nato, the demilitarisation of Ukraine, and full control over the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022 – effectively undermining Ukraine’s independence.

Some of Trump’s recent remarks have raised concerns that the US may prioritise securing a deal over protecting Kyiv’s interests. Before the call, he posted on Truth Social that “many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains”.

Europe would be uneasy about a suspension of all weapons deliveries to Ukraine as the UK and EU are **stepping up efforts** to deliver fresh military aid packages to Kyiv as soon as possible.

At a news conference in Berlin with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz, the **outgoing** German chancellor, called an end to Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure “a good start” but stressed that “there cannot be an agreement without Ukraine”.

“The next step must be a complete ceasefire for Ukraine and as quickly as possible,” he said.

Downing Street welcomed the “progress President Trump has made towards a ceasefire” in his call with Putin, according to a spokesperson, but said negotiations must lead to a “just and lasting peace for Ukraine”.

Before the call, Trump said Russian and American negotiators had already talked about “**dividing up** certain **assets**”.

The US outlet Semafor reported on Monday that the White House was considering officially recognising Crimea – annexed by Moscow in 2014 – as Russian territory as part of a potential peace deal. Washington is also reportedly discussing the possibility of putting pressure on the UN to **follow suit**, it said.

In Moscow, senior Russian officials signalled their satisfaction with Putin’s conversation with Trump.

“It is **official** now – a PERFECT call,” Kirill Dmitriev, a senior aide close to Putin, wrote on X.

#### [2025-03-19 Trump and Zelenskyy share ‘frank’ but ‘very good’ call as Ukraine accepts partial ceasefire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/19/trump-has-very-good-phone-call-with-zelenskyy-who-signs-on-to-partial-ceasefire)

Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a “very good telephone call” on Wednesday, according to Trump, in the first conversation between the US president and his Ukrainian counterpart since their disastrous **showdown** in the White House three weeks ago.

Zelenskyy described the call as “positive, very **substantive** and frank”, and said he had signed up to a partial ceasefire that Trump agreed with Vladimir Putin a day earlier. The White House said Trump had promised to help with a Ukrainian request to source more air defence **batteries** for Kyiv.

The last encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy ended in an angry **exchange of words** between the two presidents and the US vice-president, JD Vance. It marked a low point in US-Ukrainian relations and **spooked** other allies that Washington may be about to abandon Kyiv.

Since then, Zelenskyy has been eager to get relations with Trump back on track. His readout of Wednesday’s call thanked Trump multiple times, and he said he had signed on to the ceasefire plan.

“We instructed our teams to resolve technical issues related to implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram after the call.

Previously, Ukrainian and US negotiating teams had agreed on a full ceasefire, but Putin turned that down suggesting instead pausing mutual strikes on energy infrastructure and a ceasefire in the Black Sea.

Trump, posting on Truth Social, described his talk with Zelenskyy as a “very good telephone call” that lasted around an hour. “Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs. We are very much on track,” he wrote, in language that was noticeably less **hyperbolic** than some of his **pronouncements** on the conflict.

In a Zoom call with journalists late on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said he had “felt no pressure” from Trump, adding: “It was a fruitful conversation, perhaps the most fruitful we have had, the mood was positive.

“We have received signals from the United States that we are talking about the ceasefire on energy facilities, so not to attack energy infrastructure, and we are also talking about the civilian infrastructure facilities.”

Zelenskyy said his team would draw up a list of the kind of facilities they felt could be included and would present them to the Americans at upcoming negotiations.

The Ukrainian leader also said that he and Trump had discussed the US proposal to take ownership of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south Ukraine.

“We talked only about one power plant, which is under Russian occupation,” he said.

In a sign that European leaders are closely watching the discussions between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy, the Ukraine president answered a phone call while speaking with reporters on Wednesday evening and promised to call back. Returning to the briefing, he said: “That was President Macron, we have a conversation on average once a day, he’s helping a lot. I will call him back.”

Ukrainian officials say that they believe their relations with the Trump administration are now on **sounder** **footing**.

“It was a **fairly** **emotional** conversation in the Oval Office, and it showed that **contradictions** had built up,” said Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak, in an interview in Kyiv earlier on Wednesday. He claimed, however, that the two administrations quickly “found a synchronised position”, as demonstrated by the agreement in Saudi Arabia.

Nonetheless, much of the rhetoric from many in the White House continues to alarm Kyiv’s European allies. On Wednesday, Trump’s negotiating envoy Steve Witkoff described the call between Trump and Putin as “two great leaders coming together for the **betterment** of mankind”.

Podolyak said he was “relaxed” about the Trump administration’s strategy of “soft communication” with Russia. “They believe that this softer rhetoric, many personal connections, will enable them to find a level of trust. Although when I put the words ‘trust’ and ‘Russia’ together, it looks **fantastical** to me,” he said.

A deal on US access to Ukraine’s mineral wealth is still awaiting signatures. Trump’s suggestion that the US could take over Ukrainian power plants “would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure”, according to a White House statement.

There was some confusion over what exactly had been said on the call between Trump and Putin, as Moscow and Washington gave very different readouts in the aftermath.

Trump, in an initial post on Truth Social, said the partial ceasefire would apply to “energy and infrastructure”, giving the impression that it would extend to all **civilian infrastructure**. Zelenskyy, after his call with Trump, spoke about “ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure”.

However, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday that the ceasefire would only apply to the energy sector, and a White House statement on Wednesday also referred only to energy, leaving the details of the ceasefire unclear.

Additionally, the Kremlin said in a statement that a requirement for serious peace talks would be “the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence to Kyiv”.

Trump, speaking on Fox News, denied this had ever come up: “No, we didn’t talk about aid, actually, we didn’t talk about aid at all. We talked about a lot of things but aid was never discussed,” he said.

However, Peskov directly **contradicted** Trump, when speaking to reporters in Moscow: “The need to halt arms supplies to Kyiv was discussed during Putin and Trump’s conversation,” he said. Ceasing military aid would be “high on the agenda in negotiations between Russia and the US, but the topic will not be discussed publicly”, Peskov added.

Ukrainian officials dismissed the demand as unrealistic.

“It’s a very strange demand, of course,” said Podolyak. “He wants Ukraine to give up its army, to give up security guarantees, to give up its right to be in alliances, and to give up on various territories. This is what he’s been fighting for for three years, and he couldn’t do it militarily … And now that’s what he wants from the negotiations process,” he added.

There remains no indication that Putin has abandoned any of his most hardline objectives in the war in Ukraine. Kommersant, a well-connected Russian newspaper, reported on Wednesday that Putin told a meeting of senior business leaders on Tuesday that he intends to continue the fighting until he gets full control of, as well as international recognition over, the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022.
