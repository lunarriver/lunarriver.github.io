#### [2025-03-16 US says airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen will continue indefinitely](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/16/us-says-airstrikes-against-houthis-in-yemen-will-continue-indefinitely)

US officials have said airstrikes launched against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis will continue **indefinitely**, after a first round on Saturday killed at least 53 people and injured almost 100 more.

```
This morning, our teacher told us the exam had beenput off indefinitely.
```

The strikes, which aim to punish the Houthis for their attacks against Red Sea shipping, are Donald Trump’s first such use of US **military might** in the region since he took power in January.

```
After decades of hard work, China's military might has made remarkable progress.
```

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, told Fox News: “The minute the Houthis say ‘we’ll stop shooting at your ships, we’ll stop shooting at your drones’, this campaign will end, but until then it will be **unrelenting**.”

```
Despite the agreement on a 30-day ceasefire, Russia's unrelenting drone attacks on Kyiv continue.
```

Hegseth was among several senior officials underlining that the strikes were **designed to** signal a new assertive approach to Iran, and more generally in the Middle East.

```
The experiments presented in class are designed to help students better understand.
```

Michael Waltz, the US national security adviser, said in separate interviews that the strikes “targeted multiple Houthi leaders and **took them out**” and had involved “overwhelming force [that] put Iran on notice that **enough is enough**”.

```
Uprisings throughout the country were aimed at taking the tyrant out.
```

```
After all that has happened, everyone realized that enough is enough.
```

Video posted by social media users suggested Trump had earlier in the day been at his Mar-a-Lago **resort** in Palm Beach and at the nearby Trump International golf club.

```
We had a good time at the resort last week.
```

In a statement shared by state media, Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the strikes on Yemen as a “**gross** violation of the principles of the United Nations charter and the fundamental rules of international law”.

```
What this man did was a gross violation of the law.
```

The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the US government had “no authority, or business, **dictating** Iranian foreign policy”.

```
You have no right to dictate to me what to do.
```

“The explosions were **violent** and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children,” said one resident, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia.

```
The thunder was so violent that it was heard by people throughout the city.
```

A **crane** and bulldozer were used to remove debris at one site in the city and people used their bare hands to pick through the rubble. At a hospital, medics treated the injured, including children, and the bodies of several **casualties** were placed in a yard, wrapped in plastic sheets, Reuters footage showed.

```
Several cranes have been mobilised to the rescue scene.
```

```
Not all of the casualties have been transferred out of the field.
```

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday called for “utmost restraint and a **cessation** of all military activities” in Yemen.

```
Among all sides, the cessation of violence is a consensus.
```

On Tuesday, the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, the **Bab al-Mandab** strait and the **Gulf of Aden**, ending a period of relative calm starting in January with the Gaza ceasefire.

```
The Bab al-Mandab Strait has an important strategic significance, which links the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
```

#### [2025-03-17 Donald Trump: Iran will be held responsible for Houthi attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/17/donald-trump-iran-will-be-held-responsible-for-houthi-attacks)

The US president, Donald Trump, has declared he will hold Iran directly responsible for any future attacks by Yemen’s Tehran-backed Houthi rebels, who have targeted US and other foreign ships in the Red Sea.

“Every **shot** fired by the Houthis will be **looked upon**, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be **held responsible**, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be **dire**!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Monday.

Trump’s comments further escalate his administration’s new **campaign** targeting the rebels. Airstrikes killed at least 53 people this weekend and appear **poised** to continue. Meanwhile, Iran continues to **weigh** how to respond to a letter Trump sent it last week trying to **jump-start** negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly **advancing** nuclear programme.

Describing the Houthis as “sinister **mobsters** and **thugs**”, Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there”.

“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim’ of **rogue** terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control,” Trump alleged in his post. “They’re dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, ‘Intelligence.’”

It is unclear what sparked Trump’s post. However, the head of Iran’s **paramilitary** Revolutionary Guards sought to separate the Houthis’ actions from those of Tehran this weekend. The Houthis also launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though none reached the ship as it continues flight operations in the region.

Iran did not immediately comment on the post.

#### [2025-03-18 Vladimir Putin agrees to 30-day halt to attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/trump-and-putin-to-hold-high-stakes-call-on-ukraine)

Vladimir Putin has agreed to a limited ceasefire that would stop Russia targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure after a **high-stakes** phone call with Donald Trump.

But the Russian leader declined to commit to a 30-day full ceasefire, a plan pitched by Trump that Ukraine agreed to last week, **denting** the US president’s hope of bringing a quick end to hostilities. The Kremlin said Putin demanded that the west halt all military aid to Kyiv before it could implement such a plan.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking after the call, said Ukraine was **favourable** to the idea of both sides halting attacks on each other’s infrastructure but he was waiting for “details” of what had been agreed first.

Trump put a positive **spin** on the discussion, writing on his Truth Social platform shortly after the call ended that he had had a “very good and **productive**” conversation with Putin.

“We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an **understanding** that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine,” he added.

A Kremlin statement said Putin had issued an order to the Russian military to suspend strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Within hours of the call ending, however, air raid alerts sounded in Kyiv, followed quickly by fresh explosions as Ukrainian air defence targeted Russian drones around the capital.

A few hours later, Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram that Russia had launched more than 40 drones against civilian infrastructure, including a hit on a hospital in the city of Sumy.

“In many regions we can exactly hear what it is that Russia wants,” wrote Zelenskyy.

In a briefing with journalists, Zelenskyy said he was waiting for further information from Washington.

“I think it will be right that we will have a conversation with President Trump and we will know in detail what the Russians offered the Americans or what the Americans offered the Russians,” he said.

“After we get details from the American president, from the American side, we will give our answer, prepare it, and our team will be ready for technical discussions.”

If **upheld** by both sides, a halt to attacks on energy infrastructure would mark the first **partial** ceasefire in more than three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Russia has been relentlessly targeting Ukraine’s infrastructure for the past three years, while in recent months Ukraine has been increasingly able to hit targets deep inside Russia with long-range drones.

In his first public appearance since the call, Trump told Fox News interviewer Laura Ingraham: “Right now you have a lot of guns pointing at each other and a ceasefire without going a little bit further would have been **tough**. Russia has the advantage. As you know, they have encircled about 2,500 soldiers. They are nicely encircled and that’s not good. And we want to **get it over with**.”

Asked by Ingraham about Russian media reports that Putin demanded an immediate cessation of aid to Ukraine in order to get to a deal, the president insisted: “No, we didn’t talk about aid, actually, we didn’t talk about aid at all. We talked about a lot of things but aid was never discussed.”

During the interview Trump described himself as a “**nationalist**” who has “very good” relationships with Putin, Chinese president Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un.

In his earlier statement, Trump said: “Many elements of a Contract for Peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end. That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of **Humanity**, get the job done!”

A White House statement said Washington and Moscow had also agreed to begin negotiations on the “implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace”. It said these negotiations would begin “immediately” in the Middle East.

During the call with Trump, which lasted two and a half hours, Putin reiterated his concerns over **a range of** issues that he said must be addressed before a more wide-ranging ceasefire could be implemented, according to the Kremlin statement.

The “series of significant issues” included how such a ceasefire would be **enforced** and whether it would give Ukraine an opportunity to strengthen its forces and receive western military aid, it said.

The Kremlin’s account of the call said Putin set several maximalist conditions for a lasting ceasefire, including the suspension of western arms and intelligence support for Ukraine. Putin also demanded that Ukraine halt the mobilisation of new recruits.

“It was emphasised that a key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working toward its resolution through political and diplomatic means must be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the **provision** of intelligence to Kyiv,” the Kremlin said.

There was no indication that Putin had abandoned any of his most hardline objectives in the war in Ukraine. He told Trump that peace talks must “take into account the unconditional **necessity** to remove the initial reasons for the crisis and Russia’s legal security interests”.

In recent statements Putin outlined these demands, which include a commitment to keeping Kyiv out of Nato, the demilitarisation of Ukraine, and full control over the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022 – effectively undermining Ukraine’s independence.

Some of Trump’s recent remarks have raised concerns that the US may prioritise securing a deal over protecting Kyiv’s interests. Before the call, he posted on Truth Social that “many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains”.

Europe would be uneasy about a suspension of all weapons deliveries to Ukraine as the UK and EU are **stepping up efforts** to deliver fresh military aid packages to Kyiv as soon as possible.

At a news conference in Berlin with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz, the **outgoing** German chancellor, called an end to Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure “a good start” but stressed that “there cannot be an agreement without Ukraine”.

“The next step must be a complete ceasefire for Ukraine and as quickly as possible,” he said.

Downing Street welcomed the “progress President Trump has made towards a ceasefire” in his call with Putin, according to a spokesperson, but said negotiations must lead to a “just and lasting peace for Ukraine”.

Before the call, Trump said Russian and American negotiators had already talked about “**dividing up** certain **assets**”.

The US outlet Semafor reported on Monday that the White House was considering officially recognising Crimea – annexed by Moscow in 2014 – as Russian territory as part of a potential peace deal. Washington is also reportedly discussing the possibility of putting pressure on the UN to **follow suit**, it said.

In Moscow, senior Russian officials signalled their satisfaction with Putin’s conversation with Trump.

“It is **official** now – a PERFECT call,” Kirill Dmitriev, a senior aide close to Putin, wrote on X.

#### [2025-03-19 Trump and Zelenskyy share ‘frank’ but ‘very good’ call as Ukraine accepts partial ceasefire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/19/trump-has-very-good-phone-call-with-zelenskyy-who-signs-on-to-partial-ceasefire)

Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a “very good telephone call” on Wednesday, according to Trump, in the first conversation between the US president and his Ukrainian counterpart since their disastrous **showdown** in the White House three weeks ago.

Zelenskyy described the call as “positive, very **substantive** and frank”, and said he had signed up to a partial ceasefire that Trump agreed with Vladimir Putin a day earlier. The White House said Trump had promised to help with a Ukrainian request to source more air defence **batteries** for Kyiv.

The last encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy ended in an angry **exchange of words** between the two presidents and the US vice-president, JD Vance. It marked a low point in US-Ukrainian relations and **spooked** other allies that Washington may be about to abandon Kyiv.

Since then, Zelenskyy has been eager to get relations with Trump back on track. His readout of Wednesday’s call thanked Trump multiple times, and he said he had signed on to the ceasefire plan.

“We instructed our teams to resolve technical issues related to implementing and expanding the partial ceasefire,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram after the call.

Previously, Ukrainian and US negotiating teams had agreed on a full ceasefire, but Putin turned that down suggesting instead pausing mutual strikes on energy infrastructure and a ceasefire in the Black Sea.

Trump, posting on Truth Social, described his talk with Zelenskyy as a “very good telephone call” that lasted around an hour. “Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs. We are very much on track,” he wrote, in language that was noticeably less **hyperbolic** than some of his **pronouncements** on the conflict.

In a Zoom call with journalists late on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said he had “felt no pressure” from Trump, adding: “It was a fruitful conversation, perhaps the most fruitful we have had, the mood was positive.

“We have received signals from the United States that we are talking about the ceasefire on energy facilities, so not to attack energy infrastructure, and we are also talking about the civilian infrastructure facilities.”

Zelenskyy said his team would draw up a list of the kind of facilities they felt could be included and would present them to the Americans at upcoming negotiations.

The Ukrainian leader also said that he and Trump had discussed the US proposal to take ownership of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south Ukraine.

“We talked only about one power plant, which is under Russian occupation,” he said.

In a sign that European leaders are closely watching the discussions between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy, the Ukraine president answered a phone call while speaking with reporters on Wednesday evening and promised to call back. Returning to the briefing, he said: “That was President Macron, we have a conversation on average once a day, he’s helping a lot. I will call him back.”

Ukrainian officials say that they believe their relations with the Trump administration are now on **sounder** **footing**.

“It was a **fairly** **emotional** conversation in the Oval Office, and it showed that **contradictions** had built up,” said Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak, in an interview in Kyiv earlier on Wednesday. He claimed, however, that the two administrations quickly “found a synchronised position”, as demonstrated by the agreement in Saudi Arabia.

Nonetheless, much of the rhetoric from many in the White House continues to alarm Kyiv’s European allies. On Wednesday, Trump’s negotiating envoy Steve Witkoff described the call between Trump and Putin as “two great leaders coming together for the **betterment** of mankind”.

Podolyak said he was “relaxed” about the Trump administration’s strategy of “soft communication” with Russia. “They believe that this softer rhetoric, many personal connections, will enable them to find a level of trust. Although when I put the words ‘trust’ and ‘Russia’ together, it looks **fantastical** to me,” he said.

A deal on US access to Ukraine’s mineral wealth is still awaiting signatures. Trump’s suggestion that the US could take over Ukrainian power plants “would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure”, according to a White House statement.

There was some confusion over what exactly had been said on the call between Trump and Putin, as Moscow and Washington gave very different readouts in the aftermath.

Trump, in an initial post on Truth Social, said the partial ceasefire would apply to “energy and infrastructure”, giving the impression that it would extend to all **civilian infrastructure**. Zelenskyy, after his call with Trump, spoke about “ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure”.

However, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday that the ceasefire would only apply to the energy sector, and a White House statement on Wednesday also referred only to energy, leaving the details of the ceasefire unclear.

Additionally, the Kremlin said in a statement that a requirement for serious peace talks would be “the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence to Kyiv”.

Trump, speaking on Fox News, denied this had ever come up: “No, we didn’t talk about aid, actually, we didn’t talk about aid at all. We talked about a lot of things but aid was never discussed,” he said.

However, Peskov directly **contradicted** Trump, when speaking to reporters in Moscow: “The need to halt arms supplies to Kyiv was discussed during Putin and Trump’s conversation,” he said. Ceasing military aid would be “high on the agenda in negotiations between Russia and the US, but the topic will not be discussed publicly”, Peskov added.

Ukrainian officials dismissed the demand as unrealistic.

“It’s a very strange demand, of course,” said Podolyak. “He wants Ukraine to give up its army, to give up security guarantees, to give up its right to be in alliances, and to give up on various territories. This is what he’s been fighting for for three years, and he couldn’t do it militarily … And now that’s what he wants from the negotiations process,” he added.

There remains no indication that Putin has abandoned any of his most hardline objectives in the war in Ukraine. Kommersant, a well-connected Russian newspaper, reported on Wednesday that Putin told a meeting of senior business leaders on Tuesday that he intends to continue the fighting until he gets full control of, as well as international recognition over, the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022.

#### [2025-03-20 EU ready to impose more sanctions on Russia after summit talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/20/eu-ready-to-impose-more-sanctions-on-russia-after-summit-talks)

EU leaders – apart from Hungary’s Viktor Orbán – say they are ready to increase pressure on Russia through further sanctions, as summit talks exposed a **geographical** divide on rearming Europe.

Meeting in Brussels, the bloc agreed it was ready to **levy** further sanctions on Russia and strengthen existing measures after talks with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who joined by video link.

The show of unity was **marred** by Orbán refusing to support an EU text declaring support for Ukraine, which stated: “The European Council calls on Russia to show real political will to end the war.” The Hungarian prime minister similarly declined to support the EU position two weeks ago.

Orbán’s growing confidence in diverging from the EU on Ukraine raises questions about the bloc’s ability to impose new sanctions and renew existing ones, although diplomats take **comfort** from the fact Hungary has always **acceded** to the plans in the end.

Zelenskyy told the EU leaders: “Please do not ease pressure on Russia over the war. Sanctions must remain in place until Russia starts withdrawing from our land and fully compensates for the damage caused by its aggression.”

In a clear reference to Hungary’s efforts to stymie Ukraine’s EU accession talks, Zelenskyy added, without naming any country: “It is simply anti-European when one person blocks decisions that are important for the entire continent or that have already been agreed upon.”

**Separately** the Financial Times reported that Europe’s biggest military powers are discussing how to take on greater responsibility for Europe’s defence. Countries including the UK, France and Germany aim to present Donald Trump with a plan to shift the financial and military **burden** to European capitals, in the hope of a managed transfer over five to 10 years, the paper reported.

Leaving the summit, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, praised the “Buy European” policy as a major doctrine change in Europe that would make the continent more independent. In a victory for Paris, the European Commission has proposed that a €150bn (£125bn) loans rearmament programme should exclude countries without a defence pact with the EU, such as the UK and the US.

Macron also said he would host a meeting of European leaders with Zelenskyy in Paris next Thursday to discuss Ukraine’s defence, including immediate military aid, making any ceasefire work and possibly deployment of troops.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said it was of the utmost importance to develop the defence industrial base in Europe, adding that “associated countries” could be involved. “These are billions and billions of **euros** that we will spend and we want a return on investment,” she said. “And where they are spent, they will produce good jobs.”

Meanwhile, Jens Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary general who last month re-entered the Norwegian government as finance minister, said that uncertainty over US commitment to the transatlantic alliance was not a reason to “give up Nato”, but a motivation for European countries and Canada to increase their contributions.

Stoltenberg said that whether or not the US decided to reduce its Nato contributions, it was crucial for other Nato members to “stand together” and “step up”.

“We need to all do what we can to ensure that Nato remains a strong alliance between North America and Europe that has helped to keep us safe for more than 75 years. There have been differences and disagreements before but we have been able to overcome them by realising we are all safer when we stand together,” he said, speaking from Copenhagen shortly before Zelenskyy **touched down** in Norway on Thursday.

“If the US should decide to reduce their contributions to Nato, it is even more important that we stand together the rest of us in Nato and step up, as European allies now do. And not least the United Kingdom, being the second largest military power in Nato after the United States.”

He added: “I cannot rule out that the US will reduce their contributions to the Nato command structures, to the Nato forces, but I expect the United States to remain a Nato ally. The answer to that is not to give up Nato but to strengthen the European and Canadian contributions to Nato.”

Despite an EU agreement to “urgently step up efforts” to aid Ukraine’s defence, a €40bn (£33bn) EU military aid plan has **fizzled** out after it failed to win support from larger member states, including France, Spain and Italy. Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy head, who led the initiative, is now calling on member states to provide 2m shells worth €5bn, a downgrade on her original plan that **envisaged** every country contributing military aid based on the size of its economy.

Kallas **acknowledged** the plan had not won universal support: “For every country it is the domestic politics, also the understanding of the public of what needs to be done and that is different in every member state.”

EU talks on an €800bn plan to ensure Europe can deter any potential invaders by 2030 are exposing the geographical fault lines over rearming Europe.

Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said the EU summit was about “finalising the first stage of perhaps the most important project in decades: making Europe safe, armed and united against the Russian threat”.

Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, said Europe was facing a strategic choice that recalled the years before the second world war. “We have to rearm ourselves because otherwise we will be the second, next victim of Russian aggression.”

Spain and Italy, which both spend below the 2% Nato target on defence, say Europe cannot **overlook** other threats to security. Spain is urging a wider definition of defence spending to **encompass** cybersecurity, anti-terrorism and efforts to combat the climate crisis.

Its prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he did not like the term “rearm”, which the European Commission has used repeatedly in its drive to increase defence spending. It was important, he said, “to take into account that the challenges that we face in the southern neighbourhood are a bit different to the ones the eastern **flank** face”.

Earlier this month the commission outlined an €800bn plan that included a €150bn loans package and flexibility on EU **fiscal** rules that would allow countries to take on €650bn in additional debt. EU leaders have endorsed the big picture, but some countries are **reluctant** to deepen their debts and are seeking EU grants.

The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said the EU needed “a more serious discussion” on “the provision of grants to European member states in order to make the important investments that they need to do”. The Netherlands and Germany oppose any common debt that would be used to create such grants.

Stoltenberg said it was “valid” and “fair” of Trump to ask other Nato members to do more, adding: “The good news is that Europeans are doing more.”
