As a safety worker for bungee jumps and rope **swings**, Mr Fu has spent a lot of time standing on bridges. But his new job, working at the new Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge in Southern China, **takes the cake**.

“Standing on it yourself feels **thrilling** as well.”

The bridge offers bungee jumping and **slack**-lining, and there are plans for professional **Base jumping** events, according to state media.

Lin Guoquan, who runs a nearby **guesthouse**, posted on social media that his business was fully booked and there were now hundreds of people every day at a viewing platform where he used to drive guests.

Social media is **awash** with videos from the bridge, including drone vision shot by Lin

Not everyone is so **enamoured**.

“You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first,” read the hand-scrawled note on White House **stationery**.

Though Hamas has agreed to three parts of Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza – **namely** the release of all hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, surrendering power in the strip and Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza – the rest of the deal still needs to be discussed.

Logistics of a hostage-prisoner swap still need to be **ironed out**.

The Trump administration and its Arab allies, as well as regional players such as Turkey, have thrown their **weight** behind the current round of peace talks in an effort to quickly push through a truce that has **evaded** negotiators for two years. Trump has said that he wants Israeli hostages to be released this week and has threatened Hamas with “total **obliteration**” if it does not agree to the deal.

The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, criticised the ministerial meeting for not including the country, describing it as being “**concocted** behind Israel’s back”. Saar said that he hoped the meeting would not **jeopardise** the release of hostages.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/almost-55000-children-in-gaza-acutely-malnourished-lancet-study-estimates

Almost 55,000 children in Gaza are estimated to be acutely **malnourished**, the respected international medical **periodical** has revealed.

The study offers a month-by-month **breakdown** through much of the two-year conflict.

In January 2024, 5% of children screened showed evidence of **wasting**, researchers found. After Israel imposed severe aid restrictions from the end of 2024, the **prevalence** of wasting had almost doubled by January 2025.

Dr Masako Horino is nutrition **epidemiologist** at Unrwa and lead scientist for the study.

“Tens of thousands of preschool aged children in the Gaza Strip are now suffering from **preventable** acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of **mortality**,” Horino said.

Leading child health experts and **paediatricians** said the study was particularly “notable and important”.

Bhutta also praised the researchers for using scientific evidence “to show **grievous**, preventable harm to children”.

“There should also be “serious concern” over its long-term health effects, which included “**inordinately** high risks of non-communicable diseases”, they added.

The study found that in Rafah, the southern city in Gaza, there was a fourfold increase in wasting malnutrition after Israel launched a massive offensive into the city and **levelled** it.

Unrwa has been accused by Benjamin Netanyahu of being “**perforated** by Hamas” and banned by Israel.
