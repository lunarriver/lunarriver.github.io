#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/huajiang-grand-canyon-bridge-guizhou-china-worlds-highest-bridge-how-it-feels-crossing

As a safety worker for bungee jumps and rope **swings**, Mr Fu has spent a lot of time standing on bridges. But his new job, working at the new Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge in Southern China, **takes the cake**.

“Standing on it yourself feels **thrilling** as well.”

The bridge offers bungee jumping and **slack**-lining, and there are plans for professional **Base jumping** events, according to state media.

Lin Guoquan, who runs a nearby **guesthouse**, posted on social media that his business was fully booked and there were now hundreds of people every day at a viewing platform where he used to drive guests.

Social media is **awash** with videos from the bridge, including drone vision shot by Lin

Not everyone is so **enamoured**.

“You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first,” read the hand-scrawled note on White House **stationery**.

Though Hamas has agreed to three parts of Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza – **namely** the release of all hostages in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, surrendering power in the strip and Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza – the rest of the deal still needs to be discussed.

Logistics of a hostage-prisoner swap still need to be **ironed out**.

The Trump administration and its Arab allies, as well as regional players such as Turkey, have thrown their **weight** behind the current round of peace talks in an effort to quickly push through a truce that has **evaded** negotiators for two years. Trump has said that he wants Israeli hostages to be released this week and has threatened Hamas with “total **obliteration**” if it does not agree to the deal.

The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, criticised the ministerial meeting for not including the country, describing it as being “**concocted** behind Israel’s back”. Saar said that he hoped the meeting would not **jeopardise** the release of hostages.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/almost-55000-children-in-gaza-acutely-malnourished-lancet-study-estimates

Almost 55,000 children in Gaza are estimated to be acutely **malnourished**, the respected international medical **periodical** has revealed.

The study offers a month-by-month **breakdown** through much of the two-year conflict.

In January 2024, 5% of children screened showed evidence of **wasting**, researchers found. After Israel imposed severe aid restrictions from the end of 2024, the **prevalence** of wasting had almost doubled by January 2025.

Dr Masako Horino is nutrition **epidemiologist** at Unrwa and lead scientist for the study.

“Tens of thousands of preschool aged children in the Gaza Strip are now suffering from **preventable** acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of **mortality**,” Horino said.

Leading child health experts and **paediatricians** said the study was particularly “notable and important”.

Bhutta also praised the researchers for using scientific evidence “to show **grievous**, preventable harm to children”.

“There should also be “serious concern” over its long-term health effects, which included “**inordinately** high risks of non-communicable diseases”, they added.

The study found that in Rafah, the southern city in Gaza, there was a fourfold increase in wasting malnutrition after Israel launched a massive offensive into the city and **levelled** it.

Unrwa has been accused by Benjamin Netanyahu of being “**perforated** by Hamas” and banned by Israel.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/putin-russian-air-defences-azerbaijani-jet-crash

Vladimir Putin has said that Russia’s air defences were to blame for downing an Azerbaijani **jetliner** in December that killed 38 people.

Aliyev, meanwhile, criticised Moscow for trying to “**hush** up” the incident.

The controversy over the crash has **roiled** the previously warm ties between Moscow and Baku. Their relations were further destabilised by deaths of ethnic Azerbaijanis **rounded up** by police in a Russian city in June.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/china-steps-up-control-rare-earth-exports-national-security-concerns

Foreign manufacturers using Chinese **machinery** or components overseas are now expected to seek permission, although it was unclear how that would be enforced.

“This has **adversely** affected international peace and stability” it said.

The supply of the globally crucial rare-earth elements has become a **contentious** point of trade negotiations between the US and China, tested in April when a first **swathe** of Chinese export restrictions.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/how-the-gaza-ceasefire-deal-was-done-donald-trump

It is a well-known **adage** in politics that success has many parents, but failure is an **orphan**.

The turning point was a meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN general assembly chaired by Trump, soon after his **baroque** speech to the gathering.

That meant Trump dropping the **displacement** rhetoric he deployed earlier in the year, when he triggered widespread alarm by speaking of plans to develop a “Gaza Riviera”.

“People don’t want to hear this but the advantage of Trump is that once he decides to do something he is like a **juggernaut**.”

As a result Netanyahu, not a man prone to **contrition**, was ordered to apologise and say he would respect Qatar’s sovereignty in future.

The concept that Trump personally was central to a solution – indeed its guarantor – **flattered** the US president who offered himself up as the chair of the peace board, the body that would oversee the reconstruction of Gaza.

In one sense, he would be just a **name plate**, but to the extent he has a **hinterland**, it is construction.

The prospect of winning the Nobel peace prize, Trump’s **obsession**, hovered once more into view.

That meant that once his plan was published Trump did not let go, but kept the pressure up on Hamas, warning of the group’s **annihilation** if it did not release the hostages in return for 250 Palestinians.

It was the **seniority** of the negotiators who went to the talks in Egypt that revealed the **stars were finally aligning** and Hamas would be forced into releasing all the hostages it held.

During the talks, Hamas negotiators sought to clarify the names of the Palestinians to be released, **poring** over the maps showing a withdrawal of Israel’s forces.

He said: “You will see people **coexisting** and Gaza will be rebuilt.”

On the agenda are issues such as the future relationship between Gaza and the West Bank as the **nucleus** of a future Palestinian state.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-china-tariffs

Wall Street fell sharply after the US president reignited public tensions with the Chinese government, and raised the prospect of another **acrimonious** trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

This would happen on 1 November “or sooner”, he said, hinting that the move could be accelerated should Chinese officials **opt** to retaliate.

“There are many other countermeasures that are, **likewise**, under serious consideration.”

Trump repeatedly **hiked** US tariffs on Chinese goods in the spring.

But talks between officials, amid widespread concern over the impact of such **exorbitant** duties on the world economy, led to a fragile **detente**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/china-issues-rewards-for-information-about-taiwan-militarys-psychological-warfare-unit

In a separate report, the state-controlled Chinese news agency Xinhua said they created **seditious** games to incite secession.

Taiwan’s defence ministry said the accusations reflected the “**despotic** and **pig-headed** thinking of an authoritarian regime.

“Defending national security and protecting the safety and wellbeing of the people is the **unshirkable** duty of every military officer and soldier,” it said.

On Friday, Lai Ching-te pledged greater efforts to boost Taiwan’s defences, calling on China to **renounce** the use of force to seize the island.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/nepal-gen-z-protests-one-month-on-slow-change

As his friend carried him to the nearby hospital, his bloodied **trainer** was left behind amid the **pandemonium**. A photograph of the shoe later went viral, an **evocative** symbol of the deadliest day of protest in Nepal’s history, with 19 protesters killed.

One month on, Bohora is still sitting in the **trauma** ward.

He saw friends killed and **maimed**.

Many of the young people who took to the streets on 8 September say they never intended to bring about **wholesale** regime change.

The lack of any high-profile arrests of former ministers from Oli’s government is a growing **bone** of contention.

Om Prakash Aryal said one of the interim government’s first moves had been to “remove the **obstructions** and disconnect the political links”.

In an **inflammatory** speech this week, Oli accused Karki and the gen Z protesters of **ulterior** motives.

Lok Raj Baral said that rather than casting blame, the gen Z uprising should be a moment of reckoning for Nepal’s political **old guard**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/heavy-clashes-erupt-along-pakistan-afghanistan-border

“Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and **inflicted** heavy casualties on Taliban forces,” said the statement.

“We will not tolerate the **treacherous** use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan … the state of Pakistan will not rest until the **menace** of terrorism **emanating** from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.”

Pakistan has neither denied nor confirmed carrying out the Kabul strike, only stating that it had carried out “a series of **retribution** operations”.

The two countries share a nearly 1,600-mile (2,600km) **rugged** and mountainous border known as the Durand Line, which is **contested** by Afghanistan.

Gul described the clashes as a “logical conclusion of the tensions that had been **brewing** up between the two countries, particularly after the continuous refusal of the Afghan regime to take demonstrable **conclusive** action against the TTP, which is spearheading the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.”

Muttaqi said the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border was now “under control” and that allies Qatar and Saudi Arabia had **reached out** to “express that the war should stop”.

He emphasised that while the cash-strapped Taliban in Afghanistan “lacks the capacity to fight the Pakistani military **head-on**”, he cautioned that the strikes could further fuel the cross-border militant insurgency in Pakistan.

“The risk is that its recent strikes in Afghanistan will galvanise TTP to carry out reprisals, which could **invite** further and perhaps more intense Pakistani operations in Afghanistan,” said Kugelman.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/philippines-says-chinese-ship-deliberately-rammed-government-boat-in-south-china-sea

The Philippines said a Chinese coast guard ship “fired its water cannon” at the BRP Datu Pagbuaya, a vessel belonging to Manila’s **fisheries** bureau, at 9.15am on Sunday.

Just three minutes later … the same Chinese vessel deliberately rammed the **stern**” of the Philippine boat.

Beijing blamed the Philippines for the **collision**.

They said: “After more than 700 long, painful, and **agonizing** days, Omri will finally receive from his children Roni and Alma a healing embrace.

An estimate 65,000 people gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Monday morning roared their **approval** as it was announced from a stage that the first seven live hostages had been released to the Red Cross.

Julie Kupershtein, the mother of hostage Bar Kupershtein, who was working at the Nova Music Festival as a **paramedic** when he was taken, spoke to him in a video call.

“We were in the compound, and suddenly I had a conversation, suddenly I saw Bar. I screamed to the sky. Crazy. To see them, these pure, **righteous** children, alive. I’m shaking **all over**.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/ukraine-war-briefing-moscow-voices-extreme-concern-at-trump-threat-to-send-tomohawk-missiles-to-kyiv

Trump has been **mulling** potential supplies of the long-range missiles to Kyiv via European allies ever since his meeting with Putin in Alaska in August failed to produce a peace deal. Trump said last week that he has “**sort of** made a decision” on whether to send Tomahawks to Ukraine, without elaborating.

Kyiv regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said two employees of Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, were wounded in Russian strikes on a **substation**.

Like Ahmed, his uncle was also in the police, a higher-ranking **constable** dedicated to his job, which supported his family of seven children.

“It seems they have a network of spies or **informants** who can tell them about local police who take part in raids on their camps.”

The TTP emerged in Pakistan’s **tribal**-dominated border areas around 2007, amid the US-led “war on terror”. After a long and brutal counter-insurgency operation, backed by the US, by 2015 Pakistan’s military had declared a “**phenomenal** success” in eradicating TTP militants from the mountainous border area.

The Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan leaded many to fear a return to the horrors of the TTP **heyday** in the late 2000s.

The storming of the federal **constabulary** headquarters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that left six officers dead.

Militants walk openly in residential areas, where they take food from local people and are accused of **extorting** and holding businesses to **ransom**.

Nisar Ali said, the “militants **roam** freely. They ride bikes and **rickshaws** without any fear, not far from the military camps.”

“We see drones flying above our heads but most of the time they kill women, children and the elderly, even our **livestock**, but not the militants.”

A UN report last year accused the Taliban fighters of joining the TTP and the Taliban regime of giving regular aid packages to TTP fighters and a monthly financial **stipend** for its leader, Noor Wali Mehsud.

Muhammad Ali Saif said that this time round, the TTP militants were much more technologically well-equipped – using equipment  such as night-vision **goggles** and sniper weapons.

“If this **bad faith** persists, and this fight spreads to other provinces such as Punjab and Sindh, it will be catastrophic,” he said.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/hamas-deploys-armed-fighters-and-police-across-parts-of-gaza

Donald Trump suggested the militant Islamist organisation was acting within the **parameters** of the ceasefire deal.

**Simultaneously**, Israeli authorities began freeing about 2,000 prisoners, including 250 serving lengthy sentences.

Hundreds of trucks of aid and commercial goods have entered Gaza since Sunday, sending prices in markets **tumbling**.

Law and order has collapsed across much of Gaza, with armed families, **clans**, gangs, looters and militia growing more powerful.

“**Repent** before it is too late – there is no Hamas from today onward,” he said in a social media post.

One Hamas security official said a hunt was under way for Abu Shabab, adding that one of the fugitive leader’s aides had been “**liquidated**” in recent days.

But “the gate for **repentance** and general amnesty” was open for all those who joined “gangs” but were not involved in any murders.

Hamas flags and **headbands** were absent.

“It is **regrettable**,” she said.

On Sunday, Maduro, without mentioning Machado’s prize, referred to the 58-year-old **laureate** as a “**demonic** witch”, a term often used by the government.

“We want peace, and we will have peace, but peace with freedom, with sovereignty,” Maduro said at an event commemorating the discovery of the Americas, celebrated in Venezuela as **Indigenous** Resistance Day.
