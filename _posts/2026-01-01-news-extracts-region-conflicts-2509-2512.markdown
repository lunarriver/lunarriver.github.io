### Venezuela

#### [Venezuela says 11 killed in US boat strike were not gang members amid reports vessel was returning to shore | Venezuela | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/11/venezuela-boat-strike-tren-de-aragua-trump)

The emerging details came as several senators, Democrats and some Republicans, indicated dissatisfaction with the administration’s **rationale** and questioned the legality of the action.

“Our armed forces are not law enforcement agencies,” said Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a floor speech this week.

Kelly also said Nicolás Maduro was not the legitimate president of Venezuela and that he was a “**fugitive**”.

“This strike sent a clear message: If you traffic drugs toward our shores, the United States military will use every tool at our **disposal** to stop you cold,“ chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said.

#### [Venezuela starts days of military and ‘electronic warfare’ drills after US strikes on alleged drug boats | Venezuela | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/venezuela-military-exercises-after-us-boat-attacks-kill-14-people)

Venezuela says it has begun three days of military exercises on its Caribbean island of La Orchila as tensions **soar** amid US military activity in the region.

The exercise ordered by Maduro as commander-in-chief was **baptised** “Sovereign Caribbean”, said the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López.

“There will be air defence deployments with armed drones, surveillance drones, submarine drones ... We are going to implement electronic warfare actions,” he said on Wednesday, citing the “threatening, **vulgar** voice” of the US.

Public television showed images of **amphibious** vessels and warships deployed off La Orchila, where Venezuela has a military base.

The US government has released videos of two of the boat strikes and claims it has **irrefutable** evidence the people killed were US-bound traffickers, without providing details to back up the claims.

“It is **regrettable**,” she said.

On Sunday, Maduro, without mentioning Machado’s prize, referred to the 58-year-old **laureate** as a “**demonic** witch”, a term often used by the government.

“We want peace, and we will have peace, but peace with freedom, with sovereignty,” Maduro said at an event commemorating the discovery of the Americas, celebrated in Venezuela as **Indigenous** Resistance Day.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/24/venezuela-maduro-us-drug-cartel-terrorism

Venezuela’s government has accused the US of **peddling** “ridiculous **hogwash**” about its supposed role in sponsoring “narco-terrorism”.

Observers believe Monday’s decision by the state department – which accuses Maduro of leading the **putative** Cartel of the Suns – could open the door for some kind of imminent US military intervention on Venezuela soil.

It said the supposed cartel was “nonexistent” and called the US accusations “**slander**”.

“If the US launches a military intervention in Venezuela, it would mark the first interstate war by the United States in South America,” the group wrote, noting how past US military operations in Latin America linked to the “war on drugs” had “delivered not security but **a torrent of bloodshed**, **dispossession**, and destabilisation”.

**Clad** in **woodland** **camouflage** **fatigues**, Maduro told a rally in the capital, Caracas.

“I’m not going to tell you what the goal is. You should probably know what the goal is,” Trump said of his **crusade**, indicating he “might” talk to Maduro.

“Maduro and most of his cohorts view the US military threats as a **bluff**.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/01/trump-maduro-ultimatum-relinquish-power-venezuela

Donald Trump reportedly gave Nicolás Maduro an ultimatum to **relinquish** power immediately.

Maduro reportedly requested a second call last weekend after Trump declared Venezuela’s airspace “closed in its **entirety**”.

It believed “**deposing** Maduro is in the US national interest”.

Maduro accused the US of seeking to “appropriate Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – through the **lethal** use of military force”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/pentagon-wont-release-full-video-caribbean-attack

Trump at one point supported making the footage public but later backtracked and **deferred to** Hegseth.

As he left a **classified** briefing conducted for senators alongside Marco Rubio, the Pentagon chief said he would not release it in its entirety.

“How can you trust their transparency on all the other issues **swirling** about in the Caribbean?”

“It is hard to **square** the widespread **routine** prompt posting of detailed videos of every stripe with a concern that posting a portion of the video of the first strike would violate a variety of classification concerns.”

“I have asked, and will continue to ask, to see that – why, as a member of Congress and the **ranking** member in the foreign affairs committee, I’m not allowed to see it.”

Lawmakers have introduced **war powers** **resolutions** intended to stop the president from engaging in hostilities against Venezuela without Congress’s permission.

Several Trump allies who emerged from Hegseth’s briefing with senators said they had no **reservations** about his actions against Venezuela or targeting of boats.

“Keep in mind, we have an obligation to send a team to **interdict**,” he said.

“Interdicting a vessel underway, is perhaps the most dangerous mission we have in our entire military **inventory**.”

### Thailand and Cambodia

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/04/thailand-scam-cyberscam-crackdown-arrests-south-east-asia

Law enforcement agencies have yet to arrest the suspected **masterminds** of the **lucrative** networks.

In October, the US justice department indicted Chen for **wire fraud** conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy for allegedly directing Prince Group’s operation of forced-labour scam compounds across Cambodia.

Another alleged scam operation involved Yim Leak, who Thai authorities described as “the heir of an influential network in Cambodia” that conducted **fraudulent** transactions.



#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/08/thailand-airstrikes-disputed-border-cambodia

Gen Chaiyapruek Duangprapat, the Thai army’s chief of staff, said it was seeking to **cripple** Cambodia’s military capability, with the aim of **neutralising** it as a threat in the long term.

“However, Thailand will not tolerate violations of its sovereignty and will proceed **rationally** and with **due regard** for the principles of peace, security and humanity,” he said.

The Malaysian prime minister warned that the fighting risked “**unravelling** the careful work that has gone into stabilising relations between the two neighbours”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/fatal-thailand-cambodia-clashes-spread-along-contested-border-area

“Cambodia needs peace but Cambodia is compelled to counterattack to defend our territory,” he said in a Facebook post, saying his country had strong **bunkers** and weapons that would give it an advantage.

Cambodia said “renewed aggression” by Thailand had “destroyed infrastructure, damaged temples, **cultural property**, human heritage and disrupted essential public services”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/24/why-thailand-cambodia-border-clash-conflict

The latest fighting began with **skirmishes** on Sunday night.

An enhanced ceasefire agreement was officially signed six weeks ago in Trump’s **presence**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/10/trump-says-end-hostilities-thailand-cambodia

Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, the US president reiterated his global peacemaking skills, **proclaiming** that “in ten months I ended eight wars”.

Tensions have **simmered** since Thailand suspended de-escalation measures in November after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/12/thailand-set-for-early-elections-cambodia-clashes

He is Thailand’s third prime minister since August 2023, and political instability is **taking a toll** on south-east Asia’s second-largest economy.

The party put forward a number of demands, including a referendum on constitutional **amendments**, as part of a deal to support him.

“When the People’s party couldn’t get what they want, they said they will submit a **no-confidence** motion and asked the PM to dissolve parliament immediately,” Siripong said.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/12/thailand-and-cambodia-agree-to-restart-ceasefire-brokered-by-us-says-trump

Cambodia announced it had suspended all **border crossings** with Thailand.

Thai forces carried out strikes, including with fighter jets, while Cambodia fired rocket **barrages** along the border area on Saturday.

Trump’s ceasefire announcement on Friday was met with a **tepid** reaction by leaders from both countries.

“We **regret** and we’re disappointed that some of the points made by President Trump have **bearing upon** the **feeling** of the Thai people,,” he said.

Despite the deal, the two countries carried on a **bitter** propaganda war and minor cross-border violence continued.

The roots of the Thai-Cambodian border conflict lie in a history of **enmity** over competing territorial claims. These claims largely stem from a 1907 map created while Cambodia was under French colonial rule, which Thailand **maintains** is inaccurate.

The rockets are **imprecise** have a wide area of impact, with most landing in areas that have already been evacuated.

At least six of the Thai soldiers killed were hit by rocket **shrapnel**.

Even as the two countries held talks on Saturday to put an end to the **skirmish**, Cambodia reported that Thailand hit a site in the country’s north-west with an airstrike.

Despite a **shaky** ceasefire mediated by the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, and backed up by pressure from the US president, Donald Trump, renewed combat erupted in early December.

Thailand has also reported 44 civilian deaths from **collateral effects** of the situation.
