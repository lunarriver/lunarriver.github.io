### North Korea and South Korea

#### [North Korea executes citizens who distribute foreign TV shows, UN finds | North Korea | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/12/north-korea-executes-citizens-distribute-foreign-tv-shows-un-finds)

Surveillance has grown more **pervasive** since 2014 with the help of new technologies.

“They’re often children from the lower level of society, because they’re the ones who can’t **bribe** their way out of it, and these **shock brigades** are engaged in often very hazardous and dangerous work,” said Heenan.

```
pervasive ~ adjective ~ present or noticeable in every part of a thing or place

bribe ~ verb ~ to try to make someone do something for you by giving them money, presents, or something else that they want
```

#### [Kim Jong-un open to nuclear talks with US, saying he has ‘fond memories’ of previous Trump meeting | North Korea | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/22/kim-jong-un-nuclear-talks-fond-memories-donald-trump-meeting)

But there would be key **caveats**, Kim added, including Washington dropping “the absurd **obsession** with denuclearising us and accepts reality, and wants genuine peaceful coexistence”.

A freeze on North Korean nuclear weapons as “an **interim** emergency measure” would be “a **feasible**, realistic alternative” to complete denuclearisation, Lee, a liberal who favours engagement with his neighbour, told the BBC.

Instead, he has called for the resumption of inter-Korean dialogue and a more “realistic” **piecemeal** approach towards denuclearisation.

```
caveat ~ noun ~ a warning to consider something before taking any more action, or a statement that limits a more general statement

obsession ~ noun ~ something or someone that you think about all the time

interim ~ adjective ~ temporary and intended to be used or accepted until something permanent exists

feasible ~ adjective ~ able to be made, done, or achieved

piecemeal ~ noun ~ not done according to a plan but done at different times in different ways
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/19/north-korean-soldier-defects-south-across-heavily-fortified-border

A North Korean soldier has **defected** to South Korea across the rivals’ heavily **fortified** border, South Korea’s military has said.

Despite its official name, the demilitarised zone, the 248km (155-mile)long and 4km (2.5-mile) wide border is guarded by landmines, tank traps, **barbed** wire fences and combat troops.

A vast majority of about 34,000 North Koreans who have fled to South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war came via China, which shares a long, **porous** border with North Korea.

Relations between the two Koreas remain strained, with North Korea repeatedly rejecting **outreach** by South Korea’s liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, who took office in June with a vow to improve relations between the countries.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/south-korea-monster-missile-hyunmoo-5-balance-power-north

South Korea is a **signatory** to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Hyunmoo-5 is a conventional missile.

The idea for the missile was first **conceived** after a series of deadly attacks by North Korea in 2010.

However, development of the Hyunmoo-5 was blocked by US restrictions on South Korean missile payloads until 2017, when Donald Trump lifted those limits following North Korea’s **hydrogen** bomb test.

Pyongyang has **snubbed** Seoul since President Lee Jae Myung took office in June, despite Lee’s peace overtures.

He has criticised what he calls the “**submissive** mindset” of those who believe South Korea cannot defend itself without foreign military support.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/trump-heads-to-south-korea-amid-deadlocked-trade-talks-over-350bn-deal-on-tariffs

Donald Trump landed in South Korea on Wednesday to meet President Lee Jae Myung, with **deadlocked** talks over a $350bn trade deal between the two countries threatening to cast a shadow over the event.

For now, South Korea is **stuck** with a 25% tariff on vehicles, putting manufacturers such as Hyundai and Kia at a disadvantage against Japanese and European competitors, which face a 15% levy.

The president, however, promised to keep trying to “**straighten** out” the conflict on the peninsula.

More than 300 South Koreans were detained, sparking outrage and a sense of **betrayal**.

Trump **bonded with** prime minister Takaichi, whose **mentor**, Shinzo Abe, was a “favourite” of the US president.

Since taking office in January, Trump has **vacillated** on his position towards Taiwan as he seeks to strike a trade deal with Beijing.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/30/trump-gives-south-korea-permission-to-build-nuclear-powered-submarine

“I have given them approval to build a Nuclear Powered Submarine, rather than the old fashioned, and far less nimble, **diesel** powered Submarines that they have now,” Trump said on Truth Social Thursday.

While South Korea has a sophisticated shipbuilding industry, Trump did not spell out where the **propulsion** technology would come from for a nuclear-powered submarine.

“We are not proposing to build submarines armed with nuclear weapons; rather, diesel submarines have **inferior** submerged endurance,” Lee told Trump.

The **dessert** at a **luncheon** for Trump featured the word “PEACE!”, according to Seoul’s presidential office.

“It remains technically and militarily unnecessary for South Korea to acquire the technology to extract weapons-usable **plutonium** from spent fuel,” he said.

“The Trump administration should resist such **overtures** from allies as strongly as it works to deny **adversary** access to these dual-use technologies.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/03/south-korea-martial-law-president-urges-unity

He pledged that “**righteous** unity” would be possible only once accountability was delivered.

However, on a typically **crisp** winter’s afternoon in Seoul that **belied** the significance of the day, that sense of unity appeared as distant as ever.

Several hundred supporters of ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol – the **instigator** of the ill-fated martial law attempt – gathered near the national assembly.

The command aimed to ban political activities, authorise **warrantless** arrests and deploy 280 armed troops to the national assembly.

Thousands of citizens rushed to the parliament building – some helping MPs **scale** its walls to reach the chamber – 190 lawmakers voted unanimously to overturn the decree.

Prosecutors allege Yoon ordered drone flights near Pyongyang in October 2024 in the hope that a retaliatory response could serve as a **pretext** for martial law.

Despite Lee’s calls for unity, the political and social **fractures** exposed during the crisis remain raw.

“Deepening **polarisation** raises serious concerns about the long-term health of Korean democracy.”

In its editorial on Wednesday, the conservative Chosun Ilbo accused the Lee administration of an unprecedented “**rampage** and tyranny” in the way it has governed since taking office.

The liberal Hankyoreh, by contrast, warned that **sluggish** investigations and stalled court proceedings risk enabling insufficient accountability.

“Genuine **reconciliation** and meaningful reforms will be necessary to address the root causes,” she said. “The **trauma** of the martial law episode has left lasting scars.”

### Japan

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/japans-imported-baby-boom-spotlights-a-political-and-demographic-timebomb

This week brought encouraging news for Japan’s long battle to **defuse** its demographic timebomb.

But none of the women who answered calls – **invariably** issued by conservative male politicians – to have more children were Japanese.

Japan’s foreign population is **edging** towards 4 million (3.2%).

Non-Japanese faces are no longer a **novelty** in towns and cities and, increasingly, in depopulated rural regions.

Previous descriptions of Japan as a modern-day **sakoku** nation of self-imposed isolation, whose leaders refuse to lower the **drawbridge** to all but a few foreign workers, is clearly out of date.

Its rise could – as some commentators suggested – be short-lived as voters, having **registered** their dissent, return to more mainstream parties.

A snap general election **notwithstanding**, Sanseito and its leader, Sohei Kamiya, will have to wait until 2028 to build on its successes this summer.

The governing Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has vowed to bring illegal immigration down to zero and ensure that guest workers do more to **integrate**.

During the LDP’s recent contest to elect a new leader, the winner, Sanae Takaichi, opened her campaign with a **broadside** against badly behaved foreign tourists.

At a ski resort in Hokkaido, locals are protesting against plans to build **lodgings** for more than 1,000 seasonal workers, many of whom are foreign.

While Japan’s employers have answered the migrant worker question in the **affirmative**, the choice between economic decline and a more diverse population is one the country’s politicians continue to dodge.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/japan-deploys-soldiers-to-contain-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-akita

Unexpected encounters with bears are being reported almost daily in the lead up to hibernation season as the animals **forage** for food.

Officials say the soldiers will not use firearms to **cull** the bears.

Fumitoshi Sato said: “Every day, bears **intrude** into residential areas in the region.”

A team of white-helmeted soldiers wearing **bulletproof** **vests** and carrying bear **spray** and net launchers set up a trap near an **orchard**.

The Japanese self-defence forces are already **understaffed**.

On Wednesday, a woman in Akita city spotted two bears on a **persimmon** tree in her garden.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/13/amid-japans-surge-in-bear-attacks-a-torrent-of-ai-generated-videos-is-adding-to-anxiety

Headlines about real attacks and disruption appear on a **regular basis**.

Ussuri brown bears, commonly found on the northernmost main island of **Hokkaido**, as much as 400kg. And they can easily **outrun** humans.

The **sheer** number of clips could exacerbate fears that Japan is **in the grip of** an outbreak of **ursine** terror.

Several clips included details that added to their air of **authenticity**, such as references to locations where bear sightings have made the news.

Experts blame poor crops of **acorns** and **beechnuts**, which form the **bulk** of the animals’ diet, for the sudden surge in bear sighting.

The disruption to daily life in regions of northern Japan where the bear encounters are concentrated is **unmistakably** real.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/28/bear-attacks-man-public-toilet-japan

A man has been attacked by a bear in a public toilet in Japan – the latest in a **record-breaking** wave of attacks this autumn.

The victim told police he had noticed the bear, **peering** inside as he was about to leave the building.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/08/japan-tsunami-warning-after-earthquake-tremor

Glasses and bowls fell and **smashed** into **shards** on the floor.

On Japan’s one-to-seven scale of seismic intensity, the **tremor** registered as an “upper six” in Aomori prefecture – a quake strong enough to make it impossible to keep standing or move without **crawling**. In such tremors, most heavy furniture can collapse and wall tiles and **windowpanes** are damaged in many buildings.

No **irregularities** were reported at nuclear power plants in the region.

Located in the “ring of fire” arc of volcanoes and oceanic **trenches** partly **encircling** the Pacific **Basin**, Japan accounts for about 20% of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/10/japan-megaquake-advisory-north-tsunami-fears

Japan has issued a **megaquake** **advisory** after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori.

Damage from the quake was modest – 34 mostly **mild** injuries and some damage to roads and buildings.

In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake in 2011 occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 **temblor**.

The areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 **municipalities** from Hokkaido to Chiba prefecture.

Japan’s megaquake advisory last year contained a lot of scientific **jargon**, worrying and **baffling** many across the country.

Many people postponed planned trips and rushed to stock up on rice, dried noodles, bottled water and **portable** toilets.

### Crimes

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/23/rodrigo-duterte-charged-crimes-against-humanity-icc-philippines-ntwnfb

The prosecutors accuse Duterte of designing and **disseminating** a policy to “**neutralise**” alleged criminals during his term as the mayor of Davao City, in the southern Philippines, and later during his term as president, alleging he **inducted** **hitmen** to a death squad and provided weapons, incentives and immunity for killings.

They allege: “The attack included thousands of killings, which were **perpetrated** consistently throughout the charged period.”

The third charge concerns 43 murders committed during “clearance” operations of lower-level alleged drug users or dealers, according to court documents, significant portions of which are **redacted**.

As the mayor, Duterte personally inducted hitmen into an infamous group known as the Davao death squad, and “**christened**” this group by **spraying** its members with a bottle of wine and distributing guns from a basket to each, it is alleged.

His lawyer, Nicholas Kaufman, has called for all legal proceedings to be **adjourned** indefinitely, saying Duterte is not fit to stand trial due to “cognitive **impairment** in multiple domains”.

```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/26/argentina-drug-traffickers-livestream-killing-women

The murder of two young Argentinian women and a girl whose torture by suspected drug traffickers was livestreamed on a private Instagram group has sent shock waves through a country unused to such extreme levels of **narco** violence.

Investigators believe the drug traffickers planned the murders as punishment and revenge, after one of the victims stole a package of cocaine from one of the dealers, the alleged leader of a criminal group in a **marginalized** neighbourhood known as Villa 1-11-14.

They say these groups take advantage of rising poverty as well as cuts in public services under the far-right president, Javier Milei, to recruit young people who are struggling to **make ends meet**.

“We are seeing that large areas have been left at the mercy of small- and large-scale drug **mafias**, which infiltrated and ended up dominating the lives and **consciousness** of our people, especially children and young people, instilling a true culture of **delinquency** and criminality,” the Catholic diocese of San Justo, where the victims lived, said in a press release.

```
narco ~ noun ~ 

marginalize ~ verb ~ to treat someone or something as if they are not important

mafia ~ noun ~ a criminal organization that began in Sicily and is active in Italy and the US

consciousness ~ noun ~ the state of understanding and realizing something

delinquency ~ noun ~ behaviour, especially of a young person, that is illegal or not acceptable to most people
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/21/myanmar-kk-park-raid-scam-cybercrime-centre-compound

According to a report in Monday’s Myanma Alinn newspaper, Myanmar’s army raided KK Park, a **well-documented** cybercrime centre.

The army **ascertained** that more than 260 buildings were unregistered.

These usually involve gaining victims’ confidence online with romantic **ploys** and bogus investment pitches.

The centres are infamous for recruiting workers from other countries under false **pretences**.

Scam operations were in the international spotlight last week when the United States and Britain enacted sanctions against the alleged organisers of a major Cambodian cyberscam gang, and its alleged **ringleader** was **indicted** by a federal court in New York.

The company could not be immediately reached for comment Monday but its policy bans “conduct that is defamatory, **fraudulent**, **obscene**, or **deceptive**”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/british-woman-bali-execution-drug-smuggling-repatriated-lindsay-sandiford-

A British woman will avoid execution for drug smuggling in Indonesia under an agreement between the two nations to repatriate her and another Briton serving a **life sentence**.

She was arrested at the resort island’s airport after authorities found 3.8kg of cocaine worth $2.5m hidden in the **lining** of her suitcase.

She was sentenced to die by **firing squad** and Indonesia’s highest court upheld it in 2013.

Another prisoner, Shahab Shahabadi, 35, has been serving a life sentence since 2014. He was arrested in **Jakarta** as a result of an investigation into an international drug trafficking network.

She is seriously ill and is 68 years old,” said secretary of state for foreign and **commonwealth** affairs Yvette Cooper.

They included a Filipina who faced the death penalty for drugs and five Australians **convicted** of heroin trafficking.

About 530 people are on **death row** in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including nearly 100 foreigners.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/cuba-arrests-zhi-dong-zhang-chinese-fentanyl-kingpin

Zhi Dong Zhang will remain in Cuba awaiting a decision on his possible **extradition**, the sources added.

Washington under Donald Trump has been applying pressure on Mexico and China to curb drug trafficking, particularly of fentanyl: the powerful **painkiller** behind an overdose epidemic in the US.

It has largely replaced heroin and **prescription** opioids like oxycodone as a cause of overdoses in the US.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/02/mexican-mayor-killed-during-day-of-the-dead-celebrations

“No line of investigation is being ruled out to clarify this **cowardly** act that took the life of the mayor,” García Harfuch added.

On Sunday, hundreds of Uruapan residents took to the town’s streets to accompany the funeral **procession**.

At the head of the procession, a man led Manzo Rodríguez’s black horse, with one of the mayor’s signature hats placed on the **saddle**. A group of musicians, also dressed in black, followed and played **mariachi** songs.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/20/zhi-dong-zhang-mexico-drugs-china

Zhi Dong Zhang **snuck** through a hole into the property nextdoor and escaped from under the noses of the soldiers guarding him.

Zhang’s daring escape is still **shrouded** with **intrigue**.

“It’s **emblematic** of how important Chinese networks have become to the core operations of Mexican criminal groups,” said Vanda Felbab Brown.

“Zhang is what I would call a **convergence** target,” said Chris Urben. “He’s even better than a **kingpin**.”

Zhang arrived in Mexico before the **coronavirus** pandemic.

That might explain why **as-yet-unknown** actors went to great lengths to help him escape.

Nonetheless, his extradition gives US law enforcement the opportunity to **harvest** intelligence on all the networks in which he was involved.

All of this can happen near **instantaneously** and without any money crossing borders, making it harder to trace.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/philippine-president-marcos-denies-estranged-sisters-claim-he-is-a-cocaine-addict

Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos Jr has denied accusations made by his estranged sister that he is longtime drug **addict**.

Communications **undersecretary** Claire Castro described the comments by the president’s sister, senator Imee Marcos’, as baseless, and suggested they may have been a desperate attempt to distract ongoing investigations into a corruption scandal involving flood control projects that may **implicate** her allies in the Senate.

Influential members of Congress and the Senate have pocketed huge kickbacks from construction companies, which had won **lucrative** contracts to build flood-control projects that turned out to be substandard, incomplete or nonexistent.

Imee Marcos said that her brother’s drug addiction started when their father, the **namesake** of the current leader, was still a president.

Duterte has denied any **wrongdoing**.

Marcos then **laughed off** Duterte’s allegations and said he wouldn’t **dignify** the accusation with an answer.

In 2021, when Marcos was a presidential **aspirant**, his spokesperson showed two reports from a private hospital that stated Marcos had tested negative for cocaine and **methamphetamine**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/20/alice-guo-chinese-national-who-ran-huge-scam-centre-while-philippines-mayor-sentenced-to-life-in-prison

Alice Guo, a Chinese national who became a mayor in the Philippines while **masquerading** as a Filipina, has been sentenced to life in prison along with seven others on human trafficking charges, state prosecutors have said.

The sprawling complex – which included office buildings, luxury **villas** and a large swimming pool – was raided in March 2024 after a Vietnamese worker escaped and called police.

Although she was elected mayor of Bamban town, a Manila court ruled in June that as a Chinese citizen Guo was never **eligible** for the position.

Victims in the wider region were **conned** out of up to $37bn in 2023, according to a UN report.

The centres **flourished** in the Philippines under then president Rodrigo Duterte.

### US

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/unite-to-end-wars-and-tackle-climate-crisis-australian-pm-tells-un-in-veiled-swipe-at-us-isolationism

“If we **resign** ourselves to the idea that war is inevitable, or **relegate** ourselves to the status of disinterested bystanders, then we risk being trusted with nothing,” Albanese told the **chamber**.

He credited US leadership with the creation of the international rules-based order, a system which he said had delivered **generational** economic transformation.

In a **rebuttal** of Trump, Albanese called climate change an existential threat for low-lying Pacific countries.

But dozens of Australian scientists, including some of the country’s top climate researchers, wrote to Albanese this week expressing **dismay** at the target and **imploring** the government “to go further”.

Albanese quoted the UN charter and said **succeeding generations** should be saved from the scourge** of war and be allowed to live with tolerance and peace.

```
resign ~ verb ~ In the game of chess, you resign when you cannot see any way to avoid being beaten.

relegate ~ verb ~ to put someone or something into a lower or less important rank or position

rebuttal ~ verb ~ a statement that says that something is not true

dismay ~ nooun ~ a feeling of unhappiness and disappointment

```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/trump-un-general-assembly-speech-analysis

Erdoğan insisted that Benjamin Netanyahu was completely out of control, and those that were silent in the face of his **barbarity** were complicit.

We are witnessing the **constellation** of an international order marked by repeated concessions to power play.

“All around the world, anti-democratic forces are trying to subjugate institutions and **suffocate** freedoms.” Lula said.

South Korea’s president, Lee Jae Myung, insisted that the climate crisis was far from being a **hoax**, and that it represents a threat to global humanity.

One response is the alliance of **autocrats** on display in Beijing at the beginning of the month led by Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.

In his speech, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, made a pitch for the UN’s continued **relevance**, but he acknowledged the **pillars** of peace and prosperity were **buckling**, and multilateralism was suffering.

```
barbarity ~ noun ~ behaviour that is very cruel, or a very cruel act

constellation ~ noun ~ any of the groups of stars in the sky that seem from earth to form a pattern and have been given names

suffocate ~ verb ~ o (cause someone to) die because of not having enough oxygen

hoax ~ noun ~ a plan to deceive someone, such as telling the police there is a bomb somewhere when there is not one, or a trick

autocrat ~ noun ~ a ruler with unlimited power, or someone who demands that people completely obey them

relevance ~ noun ~ the degree to which something is related or useful to what is happening or being talked about

pillar ~ noun ~ a strong column made of stone, metal, or wood that supports part of a building

buckle ~ verb ~ to bend something or become bent, often as a result of force, heat, or weakness
```

At Columbia, he drew applause defending the positive **virtues** of migration and said: “Open societies are the best **antidote** to **fanaticism**.”

He added: “When the voice of a society is silenced, it ends up dying. Open societies **thrive** on words.”

Sánchez is also one of the front-rank politicians trying to build alliances to stand up to Trump, convening on Wednesday with Lula and Chile’s Gabriel Boric an alliance entitled In Defence of Democracy focusing on issues such as reinforcing multilateralism, the rule of law, and cooperation against extremism and the algorithms that weaken social **cohesion**.

But these global alliances are still in their **infancy** and ill-coordinated.

In making that decision, each country will know the strength of Trump’s **shakedown** diplomacy.

```
virtue ~ noun ~ a good moral quality in a person, or the general quality of being morally good

antidote ~ noun ~ a chemical, especially a drug, that limits the effects of a poison

thrive ~ verb ~ to grow, develop, or be successful

cohesion ~ noun ~ the situation when the members of a group or society are united

infancy ~ noun ~ the time when someone is a baby or a very young child

shakedown ~ adjective ~ becoming organized after a period of change
```

Fletcher said tens of thousands were fleeing to Tawila, where civilians, mostly women and children, faced **extortion**, violence and abduction.

That council members “condemned reported atrocities being perpetrated by the RSF against the civilian population, including **summary executions** and arbitrary detentions”.

“We need an emergency coalition of **conscience** to drive an immediate global effort to protect civilians and end the atrocities.

On Thursday, the UAE said: “We **categorically** reject any claims of providing any form of support to either warring party since the **onset** of the civil war.”

Here’s what we know so far about the **unfolding** situation.

“If the Nigerian government failed to stop the killings, Washington would “immediately stop all aid and assistance to **Nigeria**” and could “go into that now **disgraced** country, **guns-a-blazing**”.

His statement reflected renewed domestic political pressure to appear tough on the **marginalisation** or persecution of Christians abroad, a theme that resonates strongly with parts of his rightwing, **evangelical** base.

Nigeria is officially **secular** but almost **evenly** divided between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%), with the remaining population practising African traditional religions.

In parts of central Nigeria, deadly clashes between **itinerant** Muslim **herders** and **predominantly** Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water but exacerbated by religious and ethnic differences. The herders often claim reprisals for the killing of their people and **cattle**, while local communities see the attacks as ethnic cleansing targeting their settlements.

**Priests** and **pastors** have increasingly been kidnapped for **ransom**.

In the north-east, Boko Haram and its **splinter groups** such as Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have waged an insurgency since 2009, killing tens of thousands and displacing millions.

In the north-west, heavily armed criminal gangs – often labelled “**bandits**” – carry out mass kidnappings and raids that affect both Muslim and Christian communities.

Meanwhile, in the south-east, separatists seeking to revive the **defunct** state of Biafra have been linked to violence against government institutions and civilians, with most victims being Christians.

**Vigilante** groups have filled the vacuum in some states.

Meanwhile, his presidential spokesperson, Daniel Bwala, described Trump’s post as “a **miscommunication**”.

### Nepal

#### [Nepal prime minister quits after deaths at protests sparked by social media ban | Nepal | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/09/nepal-protests-social-media-ban-lifted-gen-z-kathmandu)

Nepal’s prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, has resigned after some of the worst unrest in decades rocked the country this week, set off by a ban on social media and **discontentment** at political corruption and **nepotism**.

The government decision to roll back the ban on sites such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and X late on Monday night did nothing to **quell** the anger among young people, who continued what was called the “Gen Z” protests.

In defiance of **curfews**, protests continued to erupt across the country on Tuesday and thousands stormed the federal parliament building in the capital, Kathmandu, and set it on fire. Car **tyres** were burned in the streets of Kathmandu and riot police were **pelted** with stones.

```
discontentment ~ noun ~ a feeling of wanting better treatment or an improved situation

nepotism ~ noun ~ the act of using your power or influence to get good jobs or unfair advantages for members of your own family

quell ~ verb ~ to stop something, especially by using force

curfew ~ noun ~ a rule that everyone must stay at home between particular times, usually at night, especially during a war or a period of political trouble

tyre ~ noun ~ a thick rubber ring, often filled with air, that is fitted around the outer edge of the wheel of a vehicle, allowing the vehicle to stick to the road surface and to travel over the ground more easily

pelt ~ verb ~ to throw a number of things quickly at someone or something
```

As calls for the resignation of Oli grew on Tuesday, his home was set **alight**, while homes of other prominent ministers and leaders and political offices were also attacked.

“Our prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, is extremely authoritarian and **egoistic**. As the guardian of the nation, he failed to stand on the side of the nation’s children. Now the entire generation will come after them.”

Amnesty International said live **ammunition** had been used against protesters on Monday, and the United Nations demanded a swift and transparent inquiry.

The ban on social media came after Nepal’s government gave social media firms a seven-day deadline to register under new regulations, including to establish a point of contact and **designate** resident grievance and compliance officers.

“The social media ban was not the only agenda of the Gen Z movement. The corruption that has **permeated** every level of the country must end,” said Raksha Bam, 26. “But instead of stopping that corruption, they shut down the civic space of our generation. That is why Gen Z gathered in one place.”

```
alight ~ adjective ~ burning

egoistic ~ adjective ~ considering yourself to be better or more important than other people

ammunition ~ noun ~ objects that can be shot from a weapon, such as bullets or bombs

designate ~ verb ~ to choose someone officially to do a particular job

permeate ~ verb ~ to spread through something and be present in every part of it
```

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/nepal-gen-z-protests-one-month-on-slow-change

As his friend carried him to the nearby hospital, his bloodied **trainer** was left behind amid the **pandemonium**. A photograph of the shoe later went viral, an **evocative** symbol of the deadliest day of protest in Nepal’s history, with 19 protesters killed.

One month on, Bohora is still sitting in the **trauma** ward.

He saw friends killed and **maimed**.

Many of the young people who took to the streets on 8 September say they never intended to bring about **wholesale** regime change.

The lack of any high-profile arrests of former ministers from Oli’s government is a growing **bone** of contention.

Om Prakash Aryal said one of the interim government’s first moves had been to “remove the **obstructions** and disconnect the political links”.

In an **inflammatory** speech this week, Oli accused Karki and the gen Z protesters of **ulterior** motives.

Lok Raj Baral said that rather than casting blame, the gen Z uprising should be a moment of reckoning for Nepal’s political **old guard**.

The groping of Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum by a **drunken** man has sparked outrage among women, many of whom saw their own fears and experiences reflected in her **plight**.

For some women, watching the country’s first female president being **groped** in public was a personal **affront**.

“I felt angry, enraged and **impotent**.”

“The issue of assault is like the base level on the violence **thermometer** and it **culminates** in **femicide**,” said De la Rosa.

The groping incident prompted **indignation** across the political spectrum.

“This assault, this touching that is so **invasive** of our bodies as women.”

Alicia Gutiérrez, a 40-year-old nurse, is **keenly** aware of the dangers facing women on public transport: often, she says, men get just a bit too close and once a man started **fondling** himself in front of her on a bus.

Alejandro Moreno suggested the incident may have been staged to **distract** the public from cartel violence.

The shocking public groping of Mexico’s president has prompted rapid political action to tackle **sexual abuse**.

“We need to review who has **legislated** on issues related to the agenda of non-violence against women,” said Senator Martha Lucía Mícher, who added that the senate would be reviewing state **penal codes** on sexual abuse.

“You also conduct **awareness campaigns**.”

“What worries me is that the president’s focus is **exclusively** on criminal law and she is neglecting other avenues that could be strengthened.”

“What are we doing so that men have a **masculinity** that isn’t toxic, that isn’t violent, that isn’t invasive – so that they’re not **abusive**?”

### MH370

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/03/search-for-malaysia-airline-flight-mh370-to-resume-over-11-years-after-plane-went-missing

In a statement on Wednesday, the transport ministry confirmed that the marine **robotics** company Ocean Infinity, based in the UK and US, would resume a search of the seabed from 30 December, over a period of 55 days, with operations conducted **intermittently**.

Flight MH370 **veered** off course and vanished from air traffic radar on 8 March 2014, during a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

In the years since the disappearance, vast swathes of the Indian Ocean have been **scoured** in an attempt to locate the plane’s wreckage through **multinational** and private efforts, without success.

Last year, Malaysia said it was willing to reopen an investigation into the disappearance if there was **compelling** new evidence.

Flight MH370, a B777-200 aircraft, had departed Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time on 8 March 2014, **bound for** Beijing.

Some travelled to Madagascar in 2016 to **comb** the beaches for debris.

Later that year, Australian investigators delivered their final report on the disappearance, saying the inability to **bring closure** for victims’ families was a “great tragedy” and “almost **inconceivable**” in the modern age.

The search of the seabed would be conducted **intermittently** over 55 days from 30 December.

Australia led the multinational effort, along with Malaysia and China, that covered more than 46,330 sq miles of the **seafloor** in a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean. Australian investigators the inability to bring closure for victims’ families was a great tragedy and almost **inconceivable** in the modern age.

This has been used in **drift**-pattern analysis to help narrow down the plane’s possible location.

Among the critics of the deal is former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who said **provisions** in the agreement amounted to “handing over” the country’s independence.

But public **discourse** has centred on an article of the agreement published by the White House.

“With this US deal, Malaysia will now have to work extra hard to ensure it isn’t **ensnared** in other countries’ restrictions” Noor said, adding that the country would also have to be “**diligent** about not **sleepwalking** into long-term, strategic alignment against its own interests.”

The investment, trade and industry ministry was quick to create a **microsite** and release a 15-page Frequently Released Questions (FAQs) to address concerns.

Hours before news emerged that the group had agreed to a ceasefire, satellite images appeared to show its **recruits** hiding bodies in mass graves.

The ceasefire agreement is thought to have involved the RSF’s **principal** backer, the UAE.

The RSF appeared to be conducting systematic body disposal, with mass graves being dug in trenches and **pits**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/13/canada-arctic-spy-threats-russia-china

Canada’s domestic spy agency says Russia and China have a “significant intelligence interest” in Canada’s **Arctic**.

Dan Rogers flagged mounting concerns over hostile nations growing increasingly **emboldened** in the Arctic.

Canada has increasingly flagged the **troves** of critical minerals in the region as reason to increase investment in the north.

“we’ve had to **reprioritize** our operations to counter the actions of Iranian intelligence services,” Rogers said.

Cyril Ramaphosa closed the G20 summit in Johannesburg by banging a **gavel**.

The claim has been widely **discredited**.

Donald Trump’s administration has reversed many policies designed to tackle **sexism**, racism and **homophobia**.

The G20 was founded **in the wake of** the Asian financial crisis in 1999, with 19 nations and the European Union.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/17/this-is-europe-young-people-dysfunctional-housing-system-renting

The rent average **masks** dramatic spikes experienced in some countries. If property has been a lucrative **bet** for wealthy investors, the cost of a home is a financial **ordeal** for millions of people whose incomes have been **outpaced**.

New research reported extraordinary levels of housing **precarity**:

A range of factors is driving the **affordability** crisis. But the biggest structural issue, say experts, is “**financialisation**”. In a shift dating back to the 1980s, many European governments have **disengaged** from direct social housing provision. Home ownership has slumped, even in countries where it used to be an **ingrained** part of the culture.

The resulting crisis is not just a downer for young people still sharing a kitchen with their “full **nester**” parents – it is an **economic drag**.

Essential workers are being **priced out**.

Housing **inequality** is, in some countries, feeding the success of far-right parties that **peddle** a narrative of **zero-sum** competition between migrants and locals for scarce resources. In that sense, housing has become Europe’s political **timebomb**, say experts.

On Tuesday, the European Commission unveiled its first-ever affordable housing strategy, which gives governments more **leeway** to subsidise affordable housing.

They are under mounting pressure to extend **eligibility** beyond just the poorest groups. The fact that the EU is stepping in shows at least an awareness of what is at **stake**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/28/myanmar-is-going-to-the-polls-but-its-not-the-people-who-hold-the-power-its-china

Myanmar’s military has managed to regain momentum in its battle against a determined **patchwork** of opposition groups, retaking some territory, and pushing ahead with a widely condemned election that begins on Sunday.

It is a **turnaround** for the military, which had appeared so **beleaguered** that some dared to question if it could collapse.

“This is really all China playing a role in **tilting** things in favour of the military regime,” says Jason Tower.

It was anger over the proliferation in scam compounds in border areas that led China to give its **tacit** approval to northern-based ethnic armed groups to launch an offensive against the junta in late 2023.

Earlier this year the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, expressed hope the vote would achieve “domestic peace with a **cessation** of hostilities among parties and national governance based on the will of the people”.

The Union Solidarity and Development party is providing more than a fifth of candidates and running in effect **uncontested** in some areas.

Anti-China sentiment has risen in Myanmar, including a perception that China is **stoking** conflict to increase its own leverage over the country.

“I think what the Chinese will say is that they see the situation as a **dynamism**, that a balance of power will eventually lead to some stability,” she said.
