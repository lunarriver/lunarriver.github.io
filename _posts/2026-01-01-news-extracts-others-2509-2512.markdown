#### [Nepal prime minister quits after deaths at protests sparked by social media ban | Nepal | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/09/nepal-protests-social-media-ban-lifted-gen-z-kathmandu)

Nepal’s prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, has resigned after some of the worst unrest in decades rocked the country this week, set off by a ban on social media and **discontentment** at political corruption and **nepotism**.

The government decision to roll back the ban on sites such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and X late on Monday night did nothing to **quell** the anger among young people, who continued what was called the “Gen Z” protests.

In defiance of **curfews**, protests continued to erupt across the country on Tuesday and thousands stormed the federal parliament building in the capital, Kathmandu, and set it on fire. Car **tyres** were burned in the streets of Kathmandu and riot police were **pelted** with stones.

```
discontentment ~ noun ~ a feeling of wanting better treatment or an improved situation

nepotism ~ noun ~ the act of using your power or influence to get good jobs or unfair advantages for members of your own family

```

As calls for the resignation of Oli grew on Tuesday, his home was set **alight**, while homes of other prominent ministers and leaders and political offices were also attacked.

“Our prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, is extremely authoritarian and **egoistic**. As the guardian of the nation, he failed to stand on the side of the nation’s children. Now the entire generation will come after them.”

Amnesty International said live **ammunition** had been used against protesters on Monday, and the United Nations demanded a swift and transparent inquiry.

The ban on social media came after Nepal’s government gave social media firms a seven-day deadline to register under new regulations, including to establish a point of contact and **designate** resident grievance and compliance officers.

“The social media ban was not the only agenda of the Gen Z movement. The corruption that has **permeated** every level of the country must end,” said Raksha Bam, 26. “But instead of stopping that corruption, they shut down the civic space of our generation. That is why Gen Z gathered in one place.”

He added: “We can continue to **humanise** the people involved in this war and what they are going through. I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it’s easy to become **desensitised** to what has been going on.”

The prince said he was initially invited to Kyiv by Olga Rudnieva, the founder and CEO of the Superhumans Trauma Centre in Lviv, Ukraine which treats wounded **amputees**.

“I **bumped** into Olga in New York."

“It was **remarkable**. Everyone felt an **immense** connection to them.”

While the **biennial** Invictus Games have been the focal point of much of the foundation’s work.

#### [Mexico acting ‘under coercion to constrain’ China with 50% tariff on cars, says Beijing | China | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/12/mexico-acting-under-coercion-to-constrain-china-with-50-tariff-on-cars-says-beijing)

However analysts suggested it was also designed to **placate** Donald Trump, who has been pressuring Mexico not to act as a “back door” for Chinese goods into the US.

On Thursday, China’s ministry of foreign affairs said Beijing “firmly rejects moves that are taken under coercion to constrain China or undermine China’s legitimate rights and interests under any **pretext**”.

“We will firmly protect our rights and interests **in light of** the developments of the situation,” foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular briefing.

Trump’s tariff regime has **upended** ties and alliances around the world – having moved beyond its original stated purpose of rebalancing trade relationships in the US’s favour, to being **wielded** as a geopolitical tool.

The supreme court is set to hear Trump’s appeal against that **verdict** in the first week of November and the tariffs remain in place ahead of its ruling.

```
placate ~ verb ~ to stop someone from feeling angry

pretext ~ noun ~ a pretended reason for doing something that is used to hide the real reason

#### [North Korea executes citizens who distribute foreign TV shows, UN finds | North Korea | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/12/north-korea-executes-citizens-distribute-foreign-tv-shows-un-finds)

Surveillance has grown more **pervasive** since 2014 with the help of new technologies.

“They’re often children from the lower level of society, because they’re the ones who can’t **bribe** their way out of it, and these **shock brigades** are engaged in often very hazardous and dangerous work,” said Heenan.

```
pervasive ~ adjective ~ present or noticeable in every part of a thing or place

#### [US and China reach deal to transfer TikTok ownership, trade officials say | TikTok | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/15/trump-china-tiktok-sale-ban)

“We would like to stress that the outcomes of the trade and economic consultations are **hard won**” Li said in Madrid.

The Department of Justice last year said TikTok had gathered the sensitive data of American users based off gun control, **abortion** and religion through its use of Lark, a workplace communication platform similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams, according to court documents.

Security experts have long pointed to three main areas of concern: Chinese influence campaigns, mass data collection on US citizens, and potential vulnerabilities that could **compromise** users’ devices.

The TikTok ownership saga stretches back to 2020, when Trump first ordered ByteDance to **divest** TikTok or face a shutdown. Microsoft initially pursued a potential **acquisition** worth billions of dollars, with CEO Satya Nadella engaging directly with Trump, but it fell apart in what Nadella dubbed at the time “the strangest deal” he has ever worked on.

Soon after, Walmart and Oracle came close to buying TikTok’s US **arm**, proposing a joint acquisition of a new entity called TikTok Global, but it was shelved indefinitely after the Biden administration conducted its own review of Chinese tech companies.

“We’re not going to be in the business of having **repetitive** extensions,” Greer said. “We have a deal.”

```
abortion ~ noun ~ the intentional ending of a pregnancy

compromise ~ verb ~ to allow your principles to be less strong or your standards or morals to be lower

#### [Chinese economy slows amid Trump trade war and weaker consumer spending | Chinese economy | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/chinese-economy-weakens-as-consumer-spending-and-factory-output-slows)

The disappointing data adds pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus to fend off a sharp slowdown, with a debt crisis denting the country’s once-booming property sector and exports facing stronger **headwinds**.

A spokesperson for China’s statistics bureau said on Monday that more efforts were needed to support China’s **ailing** property sector and that the “external environment is very severe”.

Although the two countries agreed a pause on tariffs until 10 November, China recorded a **slump** in US-bound exports last month.

“The activity data point to a further loss of **momentum**,” Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.

Authorities are leaning on manufacturers to find new markets to **offset** Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies and weak consumer spending.

“Policies and measures to support service consumption are expected to offset the impact of **aggregate** demand this month,” he said.

```
headwind ~ noun ~ a wind blowing in the opposite direction to the one you are moving in

#### [‘Everyone should be worried’: life in the crosshairs of China’s ‘Guam killer’ missiles | Guam | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/17/guam-reacts-to-china-displaying-new-killer-missile-everyone-should-be-worried)

But that certainty shifted slightly this month when the threat **catapulted** into the headlines, as Beijing used a military parade commemorating Japan’s defeat in the second world war to unveil a range of new military hardware – including a weapon dubbed the “Guam Killer” by Chinese media.

For that reason, displays of China’s increasing military **prowess** – this month’s event included nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles, anti-drone **lasers** and four-legged “robot wolves” – **loom** large in the territory.

“Guam should be aware of the threat, even if not so worried,” says Col Grant Newsham, a retired US marine officer, noting that the Chinese military has **outpace** the US in some areas.

“That can alter regional and global diplomacy and make coordinated actions more likely. It’s alarming because it can be a military and security **allegiance**,” Reilly says.

Local officials, however, continue to insist that defending Guam is of **paramount** importance to the US military.

```
catapult ~ verb ~ to throw someone or something with great force

prowess ~ noun ~ great ability or skill

#### [EU calls for closer ties with India despite Modi’s links to Russia | European Union | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/17/eu-calls-for-closer-ties-with-india-despite-modi-ties-to-russia)

Meanwhile the EU is **grappling** with demands from Trump to impose up to 100% tariffs on India and China, another buyer of Russian oil, to pressure Russia to end the war.

But privately, officials have **balked** at 100% tariffs, at a time when Brussels is also trying to sign a trade agreement with India by the end of the year.

Asked about the link between the trade talks and India’s relations with Russia, Kallas said: “Negotiations are negotiations and until we agree about everything then nothing is agreed.” She added that the EU had to take into account its interests, concerns and “**problematic** issues”.

But he was also **downbeat** about the latest round of trade talks, saying he had hoped to see more progress in meetings last week.

The commission is **racing** to strike trade deals around the world since Trump hit many European goods with tariffs and pressured the EU into an unequal trade agreement.

He said that a commitment to the 2026 deadline would “establish a clear timeline, and demonstrate our resolve to achieve independence from oil supplies **burdened** with political and strategic risks”.

```
grapple ~ verb ~ to fight, especially in order to win something

#### [Trump celebrates TikTok deal as Beijing suggests US app would use China’s algorithm | China | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/17/trump-celebrates-tiktok-deal-as-beijing-suggests-us-app-would-use-chinas-algorithm)

At a press conference in Madrid, the deputy head of China’s cyber security **regulator** said the framework of the deal included “**licensing** the algorithm and other intellectual property rights”.

Wang Jingtao said ByteDance would “**entrust** the operation of TikTok’s US user data and content security.”

Some commentators have inferred from these comments that TikTok’s US **spinoff** will retain the Chinese algorithm.

At arguments in the Supreme Court in January, a lawyer for TikTok ByteDance told the justices how difficult it would be to sell the platform to a US company, because Chinese law restricts the sale of the **proprietary** algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful.

American officials have previously warned the algorithm that **fuels** what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect.

“It wouldn’t be in **compliance** if the algorithm is Chinese. There can’t be any shared algorithm with ByteDance,” said a spokesperson for the House Select Committee on China.

```
regulator ~ noun ~ an official who makes certain that the companies who operate a system, such as the national electricity supply, work effectively and fairly

license ~ verb ~ to give someone official permission to do or have something

fuel ~ verb ~ to increase a feeling or a type of behaviour or make it stronger

compliance ~ noun ~ the act of doing everything that someone tells or wants you to do

#### [China’s ‘temple economy’ in the spotlight as scandals rock influential religious leaders | China | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/chinas-temple-economy-in-the-spotlight-as-scandals-rock-influential-religious-leaders)

For a religious leader, the allegations were scandalous. Mistresses, **illegitimate** children, embezzlement. But in 2015, the head **abbott** of Shaolin monastery, the **cradle** of **Zen Buddhism** and kung-fu in China, was untouchable.

The Shaolin Temple released a statement saying that he was being investigated for allegedly **misappropriating** funds and for fathering illegitimate children with multiple mistresses.

```
illegitimate ~ adjective ~ born of parents not married to each other

abbot ~ noun ~ a man who is in charge of a monastery

cradle ~ noun ~ a small bed for a baby, especially one that moves from side to side

misappropriate ~ verb ~ to steal something that you have been trusted to take care of and use it for your own good
```

The controversies reveal the increasingly **precarious** position of influential religious leaders in China, as the official support for the commercialisation of religious sites gives way to an emphasis on **frugality** and political **obedience**.

Wu is accused of **soliciting** public donations under the guise of collecting money for unmarried pregnant women and needy children, which was actually spent on personal **extravagances**.

```
precarious ~ adjective ~ in a dangerous state because of not being safe or not being held in place firmly

frugality ~ noun ~ the quality of being careful when using money or food

obedience ~ noun ~ the fact that people or animals do what they are told to do

solicit ~ verb ~ to ask someone for money, information, or help

extravagance ~ noun ~ behaviour in which you spend more money than you need to
```

In August, a video of monks from Hangzhou’s Lingyin Temple sitting around a table counting **wads** of cash went viral, catapulting the 4th century hall of **worship** into a social media storm.

In **medieval** times, monasteries stood in for banks, loaning cash to **merchants** while charging high interest rates.

The **opprobrium** comes from ordinary people who see riches as being spiritually **corrosive**, and, increasingly, from the government, which under the leadership of Xi Jinping has cracked down on excess wealth and corruption.

```
wad ~ noun ~ a number of usually flat and/or small objects pressed tightly together

worship ~ noun ~ the act of worshipping God or a god, often through praying or singing

medieval ~ adjective ~ related to the Middle Ages (= the period in European history from about AD 600 to AD 1500)

merchant ~ noun ~ a person whose job is to buy and sell products in large amounts, especially by trading with other countries

opprobrium ~ noun ~ severe criticism and blame

corrosive ~ adjective ~ A corrosive substance causes damage by chemical action.
```

But as China entered a period of economic reform and opening up in the 1980s, temples were back in **vogue**, with many turning to tourism to support themselves, often with explicit government support.

Gift shops selling Shaolin-branded **merchandise** also opened, and Shaolin **Inc** was born.

Over the years he took a **troupe** of **martial** arts monks to Moscow for a special performance at the invitation of Vladimir Putin. It led one worker near the Shaolin monastery to remark that the political **heft** of local CCP officials seemed **paltry** in comparison with Shi.

```
vogue ~ noun ~ a fashion or general liking, especially one that is temporary

merchandise ~ noun ~ goods that are bought and sold

troupe ~ noun ~ a group of performers such as singers or dancers who work and travel together

martial ~ adjective ~ relating to soldiers, war, or life in the armed forces

heft ~ noun ~ the weight of something

paltry ~ adjective ~ (of an amount of money) very small and of little or no value
```

As China suffers with **stubbornly** sluggish economic growth, temples in theory are a gift to both local governments and ordinary people. The authorities benefit from increased domestic spending as people flock to temple-**cum**-tourist attractions, while people struggling to find work or fulfilment in Chinese society are increasingly turning to religion for spiritual guidance.

But temples also must **tread** an increasingly narrow line between popularity and political obedience.

“It’s almost always that there is something else going on that has to do with **patronage**,” says Ian Johnson, the author of The Souls of China, a book about religion in China.

Xi has shown a particular interest in traditional Chinese religions. Early in his career he helped to re-open important Buddhist temples and turn them into tourist attractions, a blueprint for how the officially **atheist** Party could work with religion.

```
stubbornly ~ adverb ~ in a way that shows you are determined to do what you want and refuse to do anything else

cum ~ prep ~ used for linking two nouns

tread ~ verb ~ to put your foot on something or to press something down with your foot

patronage ~ noun ~ the support given to an organization by someone

atheist ~ noun ~ someone who does not believe in any god or gods, or who believes that no god or gods exist
```

Now it seems that the Shaolin monastery, set in the **jagged** Song mountain range, is being brought to heel. He **halted** commercial performances, banned expensive **consecration** rituals, said he would remove temple shops and said that he would eliminate other unpopular fees.

But so far, the anti-commercialisation drive is **patchy** at best. Yellow-robed monks stage daily, **spellbinding** martial arts that are free – for anyone who has bought an 80 yuan ticket to the temple complex.

It would not have been known internationally … there are **pros and cons**.

“After all, I’d also want to drive a range **rover**”.

```
jagged ~ adjective ~ rough and with sharp points

halt ~ verb ~ to (cause to) stop moving or doing something or happening

consecration ~ noun ~ the act or process of officially making something holy and able to be used for religious ceremonies

patchy ~ adjective ~ only existing or happening in some parts

spellbinding ~ adjective ~ holding your attention completely

rover ~ noun ~ a person who spends their time travelling from place to place
```

She was one of a number of independent journalists to be detained for broadcasting reports about the severe **lockdown** at **ground zero** of the pandemic.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said reports of Zhang’s rearrest and sentencing were “deeply **disturbing**”.

He said: “This is the second time Zhang has been convicted and subjected to a **custodial** sentence for this offence.”

In August 2024, she was detained and later charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, with her **indictment** citing posts on social media that “seriously damaged the country’s image”

During Zhang’s first **spell** in prison she went on hunger strike and there were reports of her being force-fed.

```

But there would be key **caveats**, Kim added, including Washington dropping “the absurd **obsession** with denuclearising us and accepts reality, and wants genuine peaceful coexistence”.

A freeze on North Korean nuclear weapons as “an **interim** emergency measure” would be “a **feasible**, realistic alternative” to complete denuclearisation, Lee, a liberal who favours engagement with his neighbour, told the BBC.

Instead, he has called for the resumption of inter-Korean dialogue and a more “realistic” **piecemeal** approach towards denuclearisation.

```

obsession ~ noun ~ something or someone that you think about all the time

The outer **rim** of Super Typhoon Ragasa has been bearing down on Taiwan since Monday as its path moves down towards the southern Chinese coast.

The barrier lake, formed by landslides triggered by earlier heavy rain in Taiwan’s east, burst its banks mid-afternoon on Tuesday, unleashing a wall of water into the Guangfu **township**.

Ragasa had already toppled trees, torn the roofs off buildings and killed at least two people while **ripping** through the northern Philippines, where thousands sought shelter in schools and evacuation centres.

An AFP reporter saw waves nearly five metres high smash into the seaside **promenade** of Hong Kong’s Heng Fa Chuen residential district around nightfall.

Ragasa – named after the Filipino word for rapid motion – is expected to make **landfall** in the central and western coastal areas of Guangdong within 24 hours, the province’s emergency management bureau said on Tuesday morning.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/23/hungary-refuses-to-stop-buying-russian-oil-despite-trumps-nato-demand

Hungary will not **wean** itself off Russian energy supplies, the country’s foreign minister has told the Guardian, despite the White House’s demand for Nato allies to stop buying Russian oil.

Some allies questioned whether he is serious about wanting to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin or merely passing the **buck** to Europe.

Bloomberg reported that the EU is considering trade restrictions that could reduce or halt deliveries of oil through the pipeline, and that they could be introduced without unanimous consent, allowing other European countries to **outvote** Budapest and Bratislava.

“I hope and expect them to **step up to the plate** soon to help us end this bloodbath.”

Asked about European pressure on Monday, Szijjártó called western European officials “**fanatics**” and said it was “totally impossible to carry out a fact-based, rational dialogue based on common sense”.

But while relations with Brussels remain fraught, the relationship with the US has improved significantly, he added, saying that Hungary was the “only European government **crossing fingers** for Trump’s victory”.

```
wean ~ verb ~ to cause a baby or young animal to stop feeding on its mother's milk and to start eating other food, especially solid food, instead

buck ~ noun ~ used in some expressions to refer to the responsibility or blame for sth

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/23/rodrigo-duterte-charged-crimes-against-humanity-icc-philippines-ntwnfb

The prosecutors accuse Duterte of designing and **disseminating** a policy to “**neutralise**” alleged criminals during his term as the mayor of Davao City, in the southern Philippines, and later during his term as president, alleging he **inducted** **hitmen** to a death squad and provided weapons, incentives and immunity for killings.

They allege: “The attack included thousands of killings, which were **perpetrated** consistently throughout the charged period.”

The third charge concerns 43 murders committed during “clearance” operations of lower-level alleged drug users or dealers, according to court documents, significant portions of which are **redacted**.

As the mayor, Duterte personally inducted hitmen into an infamous group known as the Davao death squad, and “**christened**” this group by **spraying** its members with a bottle of wine and distributing guns from a basket to each, it is alleged.

His lawyer, Nicholas Kaufman, has called for all legal proceedings to be **adjourned** indefinitely, saying Duterte is not fit to stand trial due to “cognitive **impairment** in multiple domains”.

```

“If we **resign** ourselves to the idea that war is inevitable, or **relegate** ourselves to the status of disinterested bystanders, then we risk being trusted with nothing,” Albanese told the **chamber**.

He credited US leadership with the creation of the international rules-based order, a system which he said had delivered **generational** economic transformation.

In a **rebuttal** of Trump, Albanese called climate change an existential threat for low-lying Pacific countries.

But dozens of Australian scientists, including some of the country’s top climate researchers, wrote to Albanese this week expressing **dismay** at the target and **imploring** the government “to go further”.

Albanese quoted the UN charter and said **succeeding generations** should be saved from the scourge** of war and be allowed to live with tolerance and peace.

Sánchez is also one of the front-rank politicians trying to build alliances to stand up to Trump, convening on Wednesday with Lula and Chile’s Gabriel Boric an alliance entitled In Defence of Democracy focusing on issues such as reinforcing multilateralism, the rule of law, and cooperation against extremism and the algorithms that weaken social **cohesion**.

But these global alliances are still in their **infancy** and ill-coordinated.

The murder of two young Argentinian women and a girl whose torture by suspected drug traffickers was livestreamed on a private Instagram group has sent shock waves through a country unused to such extreme levels of **narco** violence.

Investigators believe the drug traffickers planned the murders as punishment and revenge, after one of the victims stole a package of cocaine from one of the dealers, the alleged leader of a criminal group in a **marginalized** neighbourhood known as Villa 1-11-14.

They say these groups take advantage of rising poverty as well as cuts in public services under the far-right president, Javier Milei, to recruit young people who are struggling to **make ends meet**.

“We are seeing that large areas have been left at the mercy of small- and large-scale drug **mafias**, which infiltrated and ended up dominating the lives and **consciousness** of our people, especially children and young people, instilling a true culture of **delinquency** and criminality,” the Catholic diocese of San Justo, where the victims lived, said in a press release.

“Standing on it yourself feels **thrilling** as well.”

The bridge offers bungee jumping and **slack**-lining, and there are plans for professional **Base jumping** events, according to state media.

Lin Guoquan, who runs a nearby **guesthouse**, posted on social media that his business was fully booked and there were now hundreds of people every day at a viewing platform where he used to drive guests.

Wall Street fell sharply after the US president reignited public tensions with the Chinese government, and raised the prospect of another **acrimonious** trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

This would happen on 1 November “or sooner”, he said, hinting that the move could be accelerated should Chinese officials **opt** to retaliate.

“There are many other countermeasures that are, **likewise**, under serious consideration.”

Trump repeatedly **hiked** US tariffs on Chinese goods in the spring.

But talks between officials, amid widespread concern over the impact of such **exorbitant** duties on the world economy, led to a fragile **detente**.

Taiwan’s defence ministry said the accusations reflected the “**despotic** and **pig-headed** thinking of an authoritarian regime.

“Defending national security and protecting the safety and wellbeing of the people is the **unshirkable** duty of every military officer and soldier,” it said.

“Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and **inflicted** heavy casualties on Taliban forces,” said the statement.

“We will not tolerate the **treacherous** use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan … the state of Pakistan will not rest until the **menace** of terrorism **emanating** from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.”

Pakistan has neither denied nor confirmed carrying out the Kabul strike, only stating that it had carried out “a series of **retribution** operations”.

The two countries share a nearly 1,600-mile (2,600km) **rugged** and mountainous border known as the Durand Line, which is **contested** by Afghanistan.

Gul described the clashes as a “logical conclusion of the tensions that had been **brewing** up between the two countries, particularly after the continuous refusal of the Afghan regime to take demonstrable **conclusive** action against the TTP, which is spearheading the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.”

Muttaqi said the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border was now “under control” and that allies Qatar and Saudi Arabia had **reached out** to “express that the war should stop”.

He emphasised that while the cash-strapped Taliban in Afghanistan “lacks the capacity to fight the Pakistani military **head-on**”, he cautioned that the strikes could further fuel the cross-border militant insurgency in Pakistan.

“The risk is that its recent strikes in Afghanistan will galvanise TTP to carry out reprisals, which could **invite** further and perhaps more intense Pakistani operations in Afghanistan,” said Kugelman.

“It seems they have a network of spies or **informants** who can tell them about local police who take part in raids on their camps.”

The TTP emerged in Pakistan’s **tribal**-dominated border areas around 2007, amid the US-led “war on terror”. After a long and brutal counter-insurgency operation, backed by the US, by 2015 Pakistan’s military had declared a “**phenomenal** success” in eradicating TTP militants from the mountainous border area.

The Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan leaded many to fear a return to the horrors of the TTP **heyday** in the late 2000s.

The storming of the federal **constabulary** headquarters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that left six officers dead.

Militants walk openly in residential areas, where they take food from local people and are accused of **extorting** and holding businesses to **ransom**.

Nisar Ali said, the “militants **roam** freely. They ride bikes and **rickshaws** without any fear, not far from the military camps.”

“We see drones flying above our heads but most of the time they kill women, children and the elderly, even our **livestock**, but not the militants.”

A UN report last year accused the Taliban fighters of joining the TTP and the Taliban regime of giving regular aid packages to TTP fighters and a monthly financial **stipend** for its leader, Noor Wali Mehsud.

Muhammad Ali Saif said that this time round, the TTP militants were much more technologically well-equipped – using equipment  such as night-vision **goggles** and sniper weapons.

But none of the women who answered calls – **invariably** issued by conservative male politicians – to have more children were Japanese.

Japan’s foreign population is **edging** towards 4 million (3.2%).

Non-Japanese faces are no longer a **novelty** in towns and cities and, increasingly, in depopulated rural regions.

Previous descriptions of Japan as a modern-day **sakoku** nation of self-imposed isolation, whose leaders refuse to lower the **drawbridge** to all but a few foreign workers, is clearly out of date.

Its rise could – as some commentators suggested – be short-lived as voters, having **registered** their dissent, return to more mainstream parties.

A snap general election **notwithstanding**, Sanseito and its leader, Sohei Kamiya, will have to wait until 2028 to build on its successes this summer.

The governing Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has vowed to bring illegal immigration down to zero and ensure that guest workers do more to **integrate**.

At a ski resort in Hokkaido, locals are protesting against plans to build **lodgings** for more than 1,000 seasonal workers, many of whom are foreign.

Starmer said at prime minister’s questions it was “absolutely not” the case and said Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition, had made a “completely **scurrilous** allegation”.

Starmer turned his fire on the Tories, saying that “it was their failure and they are just **slinging** mud”.

Starmer added that Collins was a “civil servant of the utmost **integrity**” and that his witness statement had been made without political input.

“He had to be dragged out to repeat only more **obfuscation**.”

Pakistan rebuffed the claim as “**outrageous** and blatant lies”.

The heaviest casualties on Pakistan’s side were reported around the city of Chaman, which is just a few miles from the border and bore the **brunt** of heavy shelling from the Afghan side.

The resumption of the deadly clashes and airstrikes has pushed the two once-**amicable** neighbours the closest to conflict with each other in years and has sparked fears of wider regional instability.

However, ties between the two have severely deteriorated as Islamabad has accused Kabul of giving **sanctuary** to the Pakistan Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

The leader has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society and led a **patriarchal** turn in politics. In 2022 he unveiled a new **politburo**, which for the first time since 1997 included no women.

The government routinely **exhorts** women to fulfil what it says are traditional responsibilities of marriage and child-bearing.

It came a few weeks after more than 1,300 accounts on Weibo were given temporary or permanent bans for inciting “gender **antagonism**”.

In June, the platform launched a **dedicated** **complaints** category for reporting content that “promotes gender antagonism”.

Wang Huiling, a vlogger from rural Anhui province, shot to **fame** during the Covid-19 pandemic. Her experience of coming from a village, where social norms are more conservative, stood in contrast to the more middle-class feminist **discourse** from China’s cities.

But Wang’s **precise** reach in China is now hard to gauge because, in January, all of her social media accounts were deleted without explanation.

Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, told a press conference in Beijing on Friday that the UK had shown “disregard for **contractual** spirit, acting in bad faith and without integrity”.

He said China had acted with “the utmost sincerity and patience” and the UK should “immediately fulfil its obligations and **honour** its commitments otherwise the British side shall bear all consequences”.

The prime minister’s spokesperson told reporters on Friday that the decision over the embassy was **quasi**-judicial and “independent of the rest of government”.

Oliver Robbins, the head of the Foreign Office, is in China this week discussing the embassy application and the **refurbishments** Britain wants to carry out on its own embassy in Beijing.

But those attempts have faced multiple **hurdles**, including the two recent rows over spying and the proposed new embassy.

Beijing bought the site of the **prospective** embassy near the Tower of London for £255m in 2018. Tower Hamlets council refused permission for the project in 2022, prompting **wrangling** over whether it could go ahead.

That deadline was pushed back until 21 October after China **redacted** large portions of its plans for what it said were security reasons.

Meanwhile, reports suggest Beijing has been accessing **classified** material on British servers for several years, renewing concerns that it could use the new embassy to bolster its surveillance efforts.

Western said the proposed location posed “**eavesdropping** risks in peacetime and sabotage risks in a crisis” **owing to** its proximity to fibre-optic cables, datacentres and telecoms exchanges serving Canary Wharf and the City.

A North Korean soldier has **defected** to South Korea across the rivals’ heavily **fortified** border, South Korea’s military has said.

Despite its official name, the demilitarised zone, the 248km (155-mile)long and 4km (2.5-mile) wide border is guarded by landmines, tank traps, **barbed** wire fences and combat troops.

A vast majority of about 34,000 North Koreans who have fled to South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war came via China, which shares a long, **porous** border with North Korea.

Relations between the two Koreas remain strained, with North Korea repeatedly rejecting **outreach** by South Korea’s liberal president, Lee Jae Myung, who took office in June with a vow to improve relations between the countries.

Here are five key **takeaways**.

The first is a proposed **gallium** plant in Western Australia, to be co-located at one of Alcoa’s alumina refineries.

The US is wholly dependent on gallium imports, with China having near complete dominance over its production – it is typically **churned** out as a **byproduct** by the country’s vast network of aluminium **smelters**.

Like much of the critical mineral supply chain, China **priced out** rival gallium producers over several decades until it achieved its monopoly position.

Rare-earth magnets are used in wind turbines, medical devices, **combustion** and electric motors and ballistic missile guidance systems.

The US government is considering investing up to $US300m, but first requires further **due diligence**.

Tim Buckley says it is urgent to position Australia as “more than a **quarry** digging and shipping our raw commodities”.

The mix of government money and public **shareholder** money raises questions over who the projects will sell to, and at what price, given China is the world’s dominant buyer of materials that go into the production of high-grade magnets.

One representative of a critical minerals project told Guardian Australia the company was “**mindful** of the context in which we’ve been funded” and that there’s an assumption they “won’t be making many sales to Chinese customers”.

Australian critical minerals companies have enjoyed a **stellar** several weeks, with share prices rocketing amid hopes a new mineral boom has taken hold.

There is also the **lingering** question over how China will respond.

According to a report in Monday’s Myanma Alinn newspaper, Myanmar’s army raided KK Park, a **well-documented** cybercrime centre.

The army **ascertained** that more than 260 buildings were unregistered.

These usually involve gaining victims’ confidence online with romantic **ploys** and bogus investment pitches.

The centres are infamous for recruiting workers from other countries under false **pretences**.

Scam operations were in the international spotlight last week when the United States and Britain enacted sanctions against the alleged organisers of a major Cambodian cyberscam gang, and its alleged **ringleader** was **indicted** by a federal court in New York.

The company could not be immediately reached for comment Monday but its policy bans “conduct that is defamatory, **fraudulent**, **obscene**, or **deceptive**”.

A British woman will avoid execution for drug smuggling in Indonesia under an agreement between the two nations to repatriate her and another Briton serving a **life sentence**.

She was arrested at the resort island’s airport after authorities found 3.8kg of cocaine worth $2.5m hidden in the **lining** of her suitcase.

She was sentenced to die by **firing squad** and Indonesia’s highest court upheld it in 2013.

Another prisoner, Shahab Shahabadi, 35, has been serving a life sentence since 2014. He was arrested in **Jakarta** as a result of an investigation into an international drug trafficking network.

She is seriously ill and is 68 years old,” said secretary of state for foreign and **commonwealth** affairs Yvette Cooper.

They included a Filipina who faced the death penalty for drugs and five Australians **convicted** of heroin trafficking.

About 530 people are on **death row** in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including nearly 100 foreigners.

But like her political hero Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi will be guided by the social conservatism that made her the popular choice among MPs and **rank-and-file** members on the right of the LDP when she ran for the party leadership this month.

She opposes revising a 19th-century law requiring married couples to use the same surname, arguing that allowing women to retain their **maiden** names would **chip away** at traditional family values.

She also opposes calls for changes to succession laws to allow female members of the **imperial household** – which has few male heirs – to become **reigning** **empresses**.

Takaichi had a **comparatively** small pool of female MPs from which to appoint her cabinet.

South Korea is a **signatory** to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Hyunmoo-5 is a conventional missile.

The idea for the missile was first **conceived** after a series of deadly attacks by North Korea in 2010.

However, development of the Hyunmoo-5 was blocked by US restrictions on South Korean missile payloads until 2017, when Donald Trump lifted those limits following North Korea’s **hydrogen** bomb test.

Pyongyang has **snubbed** Seoul since President Lee Jae Myung took office in June, despite Lee’s peace overtures.

Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, later ordered **mandatory** evacuation orders for Port Royal in Kingston and six other vulnerable areas across the country including Old Harbour Bay.

In its increasingly grim **updates**, the **hurricane** centre warned that extensive damage to infrastructure, power and communication outages and the isolation of communities in Jamaica were to be expected.

Some residents in the small fishing village of Port Royal, one of Jamaica’s most exposed and vulnerable communities, refused to **heed** official advice to leave their homes and take cover in shelters.

Residents such as Ann Marie Chamberlain, 51, decided to **ride out** the storm at home. She said villagers were confident they had done everything necessary to **avert** danger, adding: “Father God will protect us.”

All the boats have been pulled up, the roofs with **zinc** have been **battened** down … we are taking the necessary precautions.

Females weren’t safe, and **to top it off** people stole our stuff.

“We don’t have any **gullies** or river to burst its banks. If a little water come up it’s maybe a few but by the time the rain ends it disappears.”

The **erratic** and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and one person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.

Local authorities have organised lines to distribute **food kits**.

It also downed trees and traffic lights, set off a series of small **landslides** and left more than two dozen communities isolated by flood waters.

The Bahamas department of meteorology said Melissa could bring **tropical** storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the south-east and central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.

The strongest hurricane is set to make landfall early on Tuesday and to **linger** over the island.

The storm is expected to slice diagonally across the island, entering near the **parish** of St Elizabeth parish in the south.

“Catastrophic **flash flooding** and numerous landslides are likely.”

“We hope that will **suffice** for any surge that will take place”.

“If you are living in a low-lying area, **sort out** yourself and move out to the best shelter.”

“Jamaicans are very deep in their faith. And I don’t say that as a means of **mockery**.”

He said critical infrastructure was located along the coast in Kingston, where the **storm surge** was expected.

Holness announced late on Sunday that he had signed a **compulsory** evacuation order for several communities along the south coast.

Before a 1692 earthquake **submerged** most of Port Royal, it was one of the biggest cities in the Caribbean.

Donald Trump landed in South Korea on Wednesday to meet President Lee Jae Myung, with **deadlocked** talks over a $350bn trade deal between the two countries threatening to cast a shadow over the event.

For now, South Korea is **stuck** with a 25% tariff on vehicles, putting manufacturers such as Hyundai and Kia at a disadvantage against Japanese and European competitors, which face a 15% levy.

The president, however, promised to keep trying to “**straighten** out” the conflict on the peninsula.

More than 300 South Koreans were detained, sparking outrage and a sense of **betrayal**.

Trump **bonded with** prime minister Takaichi, whose **mentor**, Shinzo Abe, was a “favourite” of the US president.

Since taking office in January, Trump has **vacillated** on his position towards Taiwan as he seeks to strike a trade deal with Beijing.

Some analysts believe that China is leveraging its rare earths **chokehold** in part to force the US to negotiate over the 20% fentanyl-linked tariffs on Chinese exports.

Amid the **fallout**, Trump has been making rare earths deals with other countries including Australia and Thailand, but the issue will be high on the agenda in his meeting with Xi.

“Taiwan has a lot of things that they’re worried about and **rightfully** so because of the situation they find themselves in,” Rubio told reporters on a plane between Israel and Qatar.

“If what people are worried about is we’re going to get some trade deal or we’re going to get favourable treatment on trade in exchange for walking away from Taiwan, no one is **contemplating** that,” he said.

Hurricane Melissa has torn through the Caribbean, slamming into Cuba while leaving parts of neighbouring Jamaica broken and **reeling** from ferocious winds and extreme rainfall.

The effects of the **colossal** hurricane were felt across the region.

The most intense tropical **cyclone** to hit Jamaica in nearly two centuries, Melissa is one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes observed since record-keeping began.

The prime minister has declared the country a disaster area, giving authorities extra powers such as preventing **price gouging**.

Photos showed a tree ripped out of the ground by the roots and roads submerged by **gravel** and earth.

The city’s streets were **strewn** with the **detritus** the hurricane left in its **wake**.

The roof of her shop and **adjoining** house was blown off. “It was terrible… In one of the rooms everything **caved in**.”

“I am **overwhelmed** by the situation,” he added, as he pleaded with the government to help rescue victims.

Cuba’s president said on Wednesday that Melissa had **wreaked** “extensive damage” after it made landfall overnight on the island country’s southern coast.

Many Caribbean leaders have called on rich, heavy-polluting governments to provide **reparations** in the form of aid or debt relief to tropical island countries.

“I have given them approval to build a Nuclear Powered Submarine, rather than the old fashioned, and far less nimble, **diesel** powered Submarines that they have now,” Trump said on Truth Social Thursday.

While South Korea has a sophisticated shipbuilding industry, Trump did not spell out where the **propulsion** technology would come from for a nuclear-powered submarine.

“We are not proposing to build submarines armed with nuclear weapons; rather, diesel submarines have **inferior** submerged endurance,” Lee told Trump.

The **dessert** at a **luncheon** for Trump featured the word “PEACE!”, according to Seoul’s presidential office.

“It remains technically and militarily unnecessary for South Korea to acquire the technology to extract weapons-usable **plutonium** from spent fuel,” he said.

“The Trump administration should resist such **overtures** from allies as strongly as it works to deny **adversary** access to these dual-use technologies.”

Residents in Bermuda had remained calm as the storm was expected to give the island a relatively wide **berth**. Authorities said they would close its **causeway** Thursday night and shut schools and **ferries** on Friday “out of an **abundance** of caution”.

The British government said on Thursday that it was **chartering** flights to the island.

Hurricane Melissa has been intensely destructive, estimated to have caused billions of dollars, but accurate **forecasting** and government advice meant many people who were able to reach shelters were protected.

“No line of investigation is being ruled out to clarify this **cowardly** act that took the life of the mayor,” García Harfuch added.

On Sunday, hundreds of Uruapan residents took to the town’s streets to accompany the funeral **procession**.

At the head of the procession, a man led Manzo Rodríguez’s black horse, with one of the mayor’s signature hats placed on the **saddle**. A group of musicians, also dressed in black, followed and played **mariachi** songs.

The quake also damaged the Blue Mosque of Mazar-i-Sharif, a 15th-century landmark famed for its **vibrant** **tiles**.

Yousaf Hammad said most of the injured suffered minor wounds and were **discharged** after receiving initial treatment.

In Mazar-i-Sharif, footage on social media showed the quake had caused some damage to the Blue Mosque, with AFP reporting that pieces of the **ornate** structure, particularly from one of its **minarets**, had broken off and fallen to the ground.

The **impoverished** country often faces difficulty in responding to such natural disasters, especially in remote regions.

Buildings in Afghanistan tend to be **low-rise** constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and **outlying** areas made from mud bricks and wood.

Xi, who is not known for public displays of humour, laughed and smiled as Lee’s **quip** was translated into Chinese, before displaying some sharp **wit** of his own.

The **lighthearted** exchange took place as Xi and Lee exchanged gifts on the sidelines of the Apec summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju – Xi’s first visit to the country in more than a decade.

The leaders’ conversation, captured by TV cameras, generated huge media interest in South Korea as Xi rarely **cracks jokes**, especially on a subject as sensitive as espionage.

A state media live feed of the **trio** walking into Tiananmen Square caught Putin’s interpreter saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”

“Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and even achieve **immortality**,” he added.

Lee’s spokesperson, Kim Nam-joon, said the moment of **levity** was proof that the two leaders had bonded during several meetings at the two-day summit.

Xi, who like Lee is a **keen** player of the ancient strategy board game, described the board as “**exquisite**”, according to South Korean media.

Here’s what we know so far about the **unfolding** situation.

“If the Nigerian government failed to stop the killings, Washington would “immediately stop all aid and assistance to **Nigeria**” and could “go into that now **disgraced** country, **guns-a-blazing**”.

His statement reflected renewed domestic political pressure to appear tough on the **marginalisation** or persecution of Christians abroad, a theme that resonates strongly with parts of his rightwing, **evangelical** base.

Nigeria is officially **secular** but almost **evenly** divided between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%), with the remaining population practising African traditional religions.

In parts of central Nigeria, deadly clashes between **itinerant** Muslim **herders** and **predominantly** Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water but exacerbated by religious and ethnic differences. The herders often claim reprisals for the killing of their people and **cattle**, while local communities see the attacks as ethnic cleansing targeting their settlements.

**Priests** and **pastors** have increasingly been kidnapped for **ransom**.

In the north-east, Boko Haram and its **splinter groups** such as Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have waged an insurgency since 2009, killing tens of thousands and displacing millions.

In the north-west, heavily armed criminal gangs – often labelled “**bandits**” – carry out mass kidnappings and raids that affect both Muslim and Christian communities.

Meanwhile, in the south-east, separatists seeking to revive the **defunct** state of Biafra have been linked to violence against government institutions and civilians, with most victims being Christians.

**Vigilante** groups have filled the vacuum in some states.

Meanwhile, his presidential spokesperson, Daniel Bwala, described Trump’s post as “a **miscommunication**”.

Among the critics of the deal is former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who said **provisions** in the agreement amounted to “handing over” the country’s independence.

But public **discourse** has centred on an article of the agreement published by the White House.

“With this US deal, Malaysia will now have to work extra hard to ensure it isn’t **ensnared** in other countries’ restrictions” Noor said, adding that the country would also have to be “**diligent** about not **sleepwalking** into long-term, strategic alignment against its own interests.”

Officials say the soldiers will not use firearms to **cull** the bears.

Fumitoshi Sato said: “Every day, bears **intrude** into residential areas in the region.”

A team of white-helmeted soldiers wearing **bulletproof** **vests** and carrying bear **spray** and net launchers set up a trap near an **orchard**.

Marcos’s “state of national **calamity**” declaration would allow the government to disburse emergency funds faster and prevent food **hoarding** and overpricing.

The problems may have been made worse by years of **quarrying** that caused clogging of nearby rivers.

A corruption scandal involving **substandard** or non-existent flood control projects across the Philippines has sparked public outrage and street protests in recent months.

Ferries and fishing boats were prohibited from **venturing** out to increasingly rough seas during the typhoon.

The groping of Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum by a **drunken** man has sparked outrage among women, many of whom saw their own fears and experiences reflected in her **plight**.

For some women, watching the country’s first female president being **groped** in public was a personal **affront**.

“I felt angry, enraged and **impotent**.”

“The issue of assault is like the base level on the violence **thermometer** and it **culminates** in **femicide**,” said De la Rosa.

The groping incident prompted **indignation** across the political spectrum.

“This assault, this touching that is so **invasive** of our bodies as women.”

Alicia Gutiérrez, a 40-year-old nurse, is **keenly** aware of the dangers facing women on public transport: often, she says, men get just a bit too close and once a man started **fondling** himself in front of her on a bus.

Alejandro Moreno suggested the incident may have been staged to **distract** the public from cartel violence.

The vessel is one of the most high profile signs of his long-running efforts to **overhaul** and modernise the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

The KJ-600 early warning and control plane has been successfully tested during its sea **trials**.

China’s navy said it launched the latest J-35 **stealth** fighter and J-15T heavy fighter from the Fujian.

China’s shipbuilding operates at an **unrivalled** pace but is secretive, and observers **scour** state media alerts and satellite images for signs of the latest developments and innovations.

This year the PLA has been testing several new **barge** ships, designed to create a **loading dock** from almost a kilometre out from shore, to bypass **rough seas** and rocky coastlines.

Taiwan’s defensive strategies had long included plans to move its war planes from the vulnerable west coast to the east, where they were protected by a **mountain range**.

“In an era marked by increasing **fragmentation**, volatility and rising authoritarianism” she added, to a standing **ovation** in a small chamber of the parliament.

She also mentioned China’s disruptions of global supply chains – likely a reference partly to Beijing’s **throttling** of rare earth exports to the EU earlier this year.

China’s **mission** to Europe on Saturday criticised the EU parliament for allowing her to carry out “separatist activities” in its building despite China’s opposition – adding it had made a **representation** to the European side.

The trip and speech were kept **under wraps** because of security concerns.

Ben Bland said the EU and Taiwan could do much more to deepen ties for mutual benefit in the face of worsening US-China **rivalry**.

The super-typhoon crossed over the north of the archipelago’s most populous island, Luzon, with **torrential rain**, sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) and **gusts** of up to 140mph (225km/h).

Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) or higher are categorised in the Philippines as a super-typhoon, a designation adopted to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather **disturbances**.

Warmer oceans allow typhoons to strengthen rapidly and a warmer atmosphere holds more **moisture**, meaning heavier rainfall.

More than 1.2 million people have been **pre-emptively** evacuated across the country.

Earlier on Sunday, Catanduanes was already being **lashed** by wind and rain, with storm surges sending waves **hurtling** over streets and flood waters rising in some areas.

In Guinobatan, a town of about 80,000 people in Albay province, verified video showed streets transformed into **raging torrents**.

Pope Leo **offered prayers** for the predominantly Catholic nation. “I pray for the **deceased** and their families, for the injured and the displaced,” he said on Sunday.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/08/us-china-aircraft-carriers-naval-fleet-defence

In a new era of state competition, Aircraft carriers remain an attractive resource for projecting power and conducting harder **edged** diplomacy.

It is a demonstration of Beijing’s fast-growing military power: its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, completed in 2012, was built from a **hulk** first made in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and sold on by Ukraine after its collapse.

**Ironically**, China has also invested heavily in anti-ship missiles to try to protect its coast from the US. But Beijing clearly sees “aircraft carriers as an **indispensable** element in building a navy that can independently project power and influence globally”, because they remain “unrivalled in their flexibility” and are “**incredibly** useful in a whole range of potential conflict scenarios”.

Their use so far has been as a form of **floating** diplomacy.

For now, aircraft carriers are not expected to meet a military threat with the tactical **sophistication** of Ukraine, never mind a peer-level opponent.

The Soviet **rule of thumb** in the cold war was that it would take 12 conventional missiles to bring down a super-carrier.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/10/super-typhoon-fung-wong-philippines

More than 1.4 million people were evacuated across the country as the storm triggered flash flooding, storm surges, landslides and **gale-force** winds. Deadly **mudslides** had killed least six people across the country.

Having a second typhoon hit so soon after Kalmaegi may have worsened the destruction, as torrential rain fell upon already **soaked** and destabilised soils. In northern Luzon, where mudslides killed a number of children, civil defence authorities said the ground had already been **saturated** by heavy rains.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/11/china-co2-emissions-flat-or-falling-for-past-18-months-analysis-finds

Rapid increases in the deployment of solar and wind power generation – which grew by 46% and 11% **respectively** in the third quarter of this year – meant the country’s energy sector emissions remained flat, even as the demand for electricity increased.

China’s CO2 emissions were unchanged from a year earlier in the third quarter of 2025, thanks **in part** to declining emissions in the travel, **cement** and steel industries.

Last week, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the world was facing a “**moral** failure and deadly **negligence**” if governments failed to limit global heating to 1.5C.

Experts say those targets are too **modest** to **stave off** global catastrophe and a long way from the 30% cut that is feasible and necessary.

But China has a record of **underpromising** and **overdelivering** on climate targets.

Myllyvirta said some areas of the economy were **bucking** the **decarbonisation** trend.

China is also on track to miss its target for cutting carbon intensity – the CO2 emissions per unit of **gross** domestic product – between 2020 and 2025. This means steeper **reductions** will be necessary if the country is to hit its 2030 goal of reducing carbon intensity by 65%, compared with 2005.

“The so-called Taiwan **contingency** has become so serious that we have to anticipate a worst-case scenario.”

“We have no choice but cut off that dirty neck that has been **lunged** at us without hesitation.”

Japan has long **wrestled** with the question of how it would respond to a conflict between China and Taiwan, which lies just 100km from its westernmost island, **Yonaguni**, in the East China Sea.

Lin Jian said Xue’s post was a response to Takaichi’s “**wrongful** and dangerous” remarks on Taiwan.

“China strongly urges Japan to **reflect** on its historical **culpability** on the Taiwan issue.”

“Such behaviour clearly exceeds diplomatic **etiquette**.”

This latest spat started just a week after Beijing accused Takaichi of “**egregious**” behaviour by meeting with a senior adviser to Taiwan’s president.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/china-taiwan-statements-longer-term-strategy

“The aim is to **belittle** Taiwan’s international standing, to achieve the political objective of **eliminating** Taiwan’s sovereignty.”

**Retrocession** day, on 25 October is celebrated in Taiwan to mark the end of Japanese colonial rule, but Beijing has **recast** it as the day Taiwan was returned to China – specifically the China now ruled by the CCP.

Germany’s foreign minister said his country’s long standing position opposed “violent change” in the status quo that keeps the **tenuous** peace in the Taiwan Strait.

“Those who only call for no change of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait are actually aiding and **abetting** ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities**,**”

“Every inch of Taiwan Province, China, is **vibrant** under the “Jilin-1” space satellite’s perspective.”

In Taiwan, people and officials called the photos **voyeuristic**.

“If the point that China is trying to make with these satellite pictures is that it owns everything it took pictures of, then that’s just plain **immature**.”

Chinese officials sought to brush off the **characterisation**. “It is normal for Chinese satellites to look at the **magnificent** mountains and rivers of China’s Taiwan.”

These moves could help “prepare ground” for Xi seeking US **concessions** on its protection of Taiwan.

The detention of Dong has been criticised by international human rights and **press freedom** organisations.

He won a prestigious Nieman **fellowship** at Harvard University in 2006.

The Nieman Foundation has described Dong as a “**cherished** member” of the international Nieman community.

Dong’s **indictment** mentioned several senior Japanese diplomats who do not appear to have been expelled from China despite being involved with Dong’s alleged **espionage ring**.

“It’s pretty obvious there is no legal **argument** to uphold the verdict.”

His **incarceration** shows that China’s reform era is really over.”

In 2017, he was threatened with a **demotion** after a Chinese Communist party investigation deemed his writing “anti-socialist”.

Beh Lih Yi said Dong’s imprisonment “creates a **chilling** effect designed to stop or prevent any Chinese from speaking with foreigners.”

“You also conduct **awareness campaigns**.”

“What worries me is that the president’s focus is **exclusively** on criminal law and she is neglecting other avenues that could be strengthened.”

“What are we doing so that men have a **masculinity** that isn’t toxic, that isn’t violent, that isn’t invasive – so that they’re not **abusive**?”

Sanae Takaichi told Japan’s parliament on 7 November that the use of force against the self-ruled island claimed by China could **warrant** a military response from Tokyo.

In the **since-removed** statement on social media, Xue posted about “(cutting) off that dirty neck”. Japan’s ruling party has since passed a resolution calling for the envoy to be declared **persona non grata**.

Takaichi, a conservative and China hawk, has toned down her rhetoric since **assuming office** last month.

If an emergency in Taiwan **entails** “**battleships** and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival of Japan, **any way you slice it**”, she said.

Despite the escalating diplomatic spat, Takaichi has since indicated she has no intention of **retracting** her statement.

China and Japan have repeatedly **faced off** around the islands.

Chinese military **transits** there are not rare.

China’s consul general in Osaka prompted a formal protest from Tokyo by commenting that “the dirty head that **sticks** itself out must be cut off”.

China’s defence ministry declared that any Japanese intervention would be **doomed to fail**.

Three Chinese airlines said on Saturday that tickets to Japan could be **refunded** or changed for free.

Late on Saturday, a Chinese state media editorial accused Takaichi of staging a **political stunt** that was “not just dangerously provocative but fundamentally **perverse**”.

“A conflict between Japan and China would not be a limited **skirmish**.”

However, China’s ruling Communist party says the unification of Taiwan with the People’s Republic of China is “inevitable”, and casts any opposition to it as **escalatory**.

The quarrel **kicked off** after Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested Japan could become militarily involved in a conflict between China and Taiwan.

“The so-called Taiwan contingency has become so serious that we have to anticipate a **worst-case** scenario,” Takaichi said.

Takaichi **hails from** the right of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and shares hawkish views on China once **espoused** by Shinzo Abe.

On Monday, China’s embassy in Japan posted on its social media a reminder that it had not **renounced** using force to take Taiwan.

In the **immediate term**, the row is more likely to have an impact on bilateral economic and people-to-people ties between the key trading partners.

“I also urge China to exercise restraint and demonstrate the conduct **befitting** a major power, rather than becoming a troublemaker for regional peace and stability,” Lai said.

Billions of dollars in flood mitigation funds have **evaporated**. Organised by the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), a powerful **sect** in the Philippines, the three-day rally has shut down schools, roads and offices. Families have journeyed from across the country to set up camp, some equipped with **portable** stoves and rice cookers, many of them **bearing placards** saying “expose the **deeds**”.

The focus of the fury is on government officials accused of **pocketing** billions in funds for substandard or nonexistent flood protection projects. Since the scandal began, the country’s economic planning minister has said up to 70% of public funds **allotted** for flood control may have been lost to corruption.

The absence of those protections is **felt keenly** in the Philippines.

But the hundreds of thousands gathered in Rizal Park could **spell trouble** for Marcos. The rally has been organised and endorsed by the INC, a Philippine **megachurch** that commands a membership of close to 3 million.

In the years since their election, however, Marcos and Duterte have turned from allies to **feuding** political rivals.

China is the second largest source of tourists to Japan, and its students form the bulk of Japan’s international student **cohort**. Shares in Japanese retail and travel companies **slumped** on Monday in response to the measures.

The travel cancellations are among a growing list of economic countermeasures after what had until Sunday been mostly a **rhetorical** reaction.

The Chinese **polling** partner told the Guardian that the questions were asked before the dispute began and the results “do not represent the current state of China-Japan relations”.

State media have claimed that **box office** sales for an already released Japanese film, Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, have slumped in recent days.

The prospect of Japanese involvement in the event of an attack on Taiwan is **alarming** for Beijing.

Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos Jr has denied accusations made by his estranged sister that he is longtime drug **addict**.

Communications **undersecretary** Claire Castro described the comments by the president’s sister, senator Imee Marcos’, as baseless, and suggested they may have been a desperate attempt to distract ongoing investigations into a corruption scandal involving flood control projects that may **implicate** her allies in the Senate.

Influential members of Congress and the Senate have pocketed huge kickbacks from construction companies, which had won **lucrative** contracts to build flood-control projects that turned out to be substandard, incomplete or nonexistent.

Imee Marcos said that her brother’s drug addiction started when their father, the **namesake** of the current leader, was still a president.

Duterte has denied any **wrongdoing**.

Marcos then **laughed off** Duterte’s allegations and said he wouldn’t **dignify** the accusation with an answer.

In 2021, when Marcos was a presidential **aspirant**, his spokesperson showed two reports from a private hospital that stated Marcos had tested negative for cocaine and **methamphetamine**.

He said increased activity of the volcano on Wednesday afternoon prompted authorities to widen the danger zone to 8km (5 miles) from the **crater**.

Residents, some with faces **smeared** with volcanic dust and rain, fled to temporary shelters or left for other safe areas.

The group included 137 climbers, 15 **porters**, seven guides and six tourism officials.

“I would also like to emphasise that due to Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi’s recent actions that **go against the tide** and her **erroneous** remarks on major issues such as Taiwan, which have triggered strong public outrage in China, there would be no market for Japanese seafood in the current climate even if Japan were able to export it to China.”

Over the weekend, China sent a coastguard fleet through the disputed waters around the Senkaku Islands and military drones past Japan’s most **westerly** territory, Yonaguni Island, close to Taiwan’s east coast.

On Tuesday, China’s **permanent representative** to the UN, Fu Cong, told a forum that Japan was “totally unqualified” for a permanent seat on the UN security council, citing Takaichi’s remarks.

Luke Pollard said a warning given to parliamentarians on Tuesday that China was attempting to recruit individuals with access to sensitive information should also be **heeded** by the public at large.

“Because as we become more online as a community, the ability for people that wish us harm or wish us to gain access to information they shouldn’t have access to becomes more **plentiful**.”

The security minister, Dan Jarvis, said in parliament on Tuesday it was “a covert and **calculated**” attempt by the Chinese government to recruit people close to power.

In response, Beijing accused the UK spy agency of “groundlessly **hyping** up” the issue.

The Crown Prosecution Service said it had been forced to abandon the case after the government failed to provide reassurance that China was “a current threat to national security”, a **threshold** that needed to be met to go ahead with the prosecution.

The **wording** of the 1911 law around espionage refers to gathering information “directly or indirectly useful to an enemy”, a definition that could have strained the UK’s already fragile relationship with the superpower.

Zhi Dong Zhang **snuck** through a hole into the property nextdoor and escaped from under the noses of the soldiers guarding him.

Zhang’s daring escape is still **shrouded** with **intrigue**.

“It’s **emblematic** of how important Chinese networks have become to the core operations of Mexican criminal groups,” said Vanda Felbab Brown.

“Zhang is what I would call a **convergence** target,” said Chris Urben. “He’s even better than a **kingpin**.”

Zhang arrived in Mexico before the **coronavirus** pandemic.

That might explain why **as-yet-unknown** actors went to great lengths to help him escape.

Nonetheless, his extradition gives US law enforcement the opportunity to **harvest** intelligence on all the networks in which he was involved.

All of this can happen near **instantaneously** and without any money crossing borders, making it harder to trace.

Alice Guo, a Chinese national who became a mayor in the Philippines while **masquerading** as a Filipina, has been sentenced to life in prison along with seven others on human trafficking charges, state prosecutors have said.

The sprawling complex – which included office buildings, luxury **villas** and a large swimming pool – was raided in March 2024 after a Vietnamese worker escaped and called police.

Although she was elected mayor of Bamban town, a Manila court ruled in June that as a Chinese citizen Guo was never **eligible** for the position.

Victims in the wider region were **conned** out of up to $37bn in 2023, according to a UN report.

When she selected her **wardrobe** for this weekend’s G20 summit in South Africa, Sanae Takaichi took extra care to choose something that – in her words – would “give her the upper hand” in negotiations.

But she never got the opportunity to test the theory in what would have been her most **pressing engagement** – talks with the Chinese premier.

Instead, they kept their distance during a group photoshoot on Saturday – setting a **frosty** tone that would continue for the rest of the summit, despite speculation that a brief handshake and exchange of **courtesies** was a possibility.

She did not, though, agree to Beijing’s main condition for an end to the row – a retraction of her assertion this month that Japan would be **entitled** to engage in “collective self-defence” if an emergency in the Taiwan Strait created a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan.

Given the scale of their economic ties, the measures are comparatively minor, but they could also be the **harbinger** of more serious retaliation.

But her **intransigence** over Taiwan is doing her little harm with the public.

**Tellingly**, almost 49% supported Japan’s right to engage in collective self-defence in the event of a Taiwan crisis, compared with 44.2% against.

A **tentative** deal reached in October’s meeting in South Korea.

Meanwhile, Beijing would buy at least 12m **metric** tons of American soya beans by the end of this year.

The **intricate** **lattices** of poles bound together by zip ties and wrapped around **gleaming** sky-scrapers are a **ubiquitous** sight across the city.

The natural **variation** in the size and shape of the poles means that binding them together into a scaffold requires the skilled eye of bamboo master.

Lai and defence minister announced the spending **bump** – an increase of at least $8bn on what had previously been flagged.

“History has proven that compromising with aggression only brings war and **enslavement**,” he said.

He said Beijing’s offer of a Hong Kong-style ‘one country two systems’ governance under Chinese rule should be formally considered an “**inviolable** red line for Taiwanese society”.

A spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, Peng Qingen, earlier told a press briefing that Taiwan was **squandering** money on “**currying** favour with external powers”.

China’s government accused Japan of deliberately **stoking** regional tensions.

A record number of people are set to take China’s notoriously **gruelling** national civil service exam this weekend.

Some jobs are particularly **in demand**.

China’s ageing population and **dwindling** pension budget has forced a reckoning with its relatively low retirement ages. The **statutory** retirement age for women will increase from 50 to 55 for those in **blue-collar** jobs.

In recent years some **debt-ridden** local authorities have struggled to pay wages at all. **Harking** back to the Maoist era, civil services jobs are known as providing the “iron rice bowl”.

“The **occupational** structure of China’s job market has shifted markedly over the last decade. In the latter, formal **contractual** obligations are weak,” said George Magnus.

In 2023 the government temporarily stopped publishing youth unemployment figures, which had reached a record 21.3%, resuming publication after a few months with a new **methodology** that excludes students.

And next year, China is **bracing itself for** a record 12.7 million graduates.

The raising of the age limit for the exams has generally been welcomed, especially as it could help workers avoid the **well-documented** “curse of 35”.

Questions from last year covered Xi Jinping’s major speeches of the past 12 months and Communist party **plenums**.

It involved pre-dawn starts and **cramming** in study sessions around **childcare**, with the result being four to five hours of sleep a night.

The flooding has submerged homes, **inundated** agricultural fields. Some people **clung** to trees or stood on rooftops.

By Sunday afternoon, rain had **subsided** across Sri Lanka.

Military helicopters have been deployed to **airlift** stranded people and deliver food.

That would be China’s biggest diplomatic **outpost** in the world. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that **consolidating** China’s seven existing diplomatic sites in London into a single embassy “clearly brings security advantages”.

In a speech on Monday night, he argued that the government could not continue to **blow “hot and cold”** on China and needed to strike a balance.

He described China as a “nation of immense scale, ambition and **ingenuity**” and “a **defining** force in technology, in trade and global governance”.

“Our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by **illusion**. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and **sober** realism,” Starmer said.

Yvette Cooper said their departments had “carefully considered the **breadth** of considerations” related to the proposed embassy.

In a statement on Wednesday, the transport ministry confirmed that the marine **robotics** company Ocean Infinity, based in the UK and US, would resume a search of the seabed from 30 December, over a period of 55 days, with operations conducted **intermittently**.

Flight MH370 **veered** off course and vanished from air traffic radar on 8 March 2014, during a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

In the years since the disappearance, vast swathes of the Indian Ocean have been **scoured** in an attempt to locate the plane’s wreckage through **multinational** and private efforts, without success.

Last year, Malaysia said it was willing to reopen an investigation into the disappearance if there was **compelling** new evidence.

Flight MH370, a B777-200 aircraft, had departed Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time on 8 March 2014, **bound for** Beijing.

Some travelled to Madagascar in 2016 to **comb** the beaches for debris.

Later that year, Australian investigators delivered their final report on the disappearance, saying the inability to **bring closure** for victims’ families was a “great tragedy” and “almost **inconceivable**” in the modern age.

He pledged that “**righteous** unity” would be possible only once accountability was delivered.

However, on a typically **crisp** winter’s afternoon in Seoul that **belied** the significance of the day, that sense of unity appeared as distant as ever.

Several hundred supporters of ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol – the **instigator** of the ill-fated martial law attempt – gathered near the national assembly.

The command aimed to ban political activities, authorise **warrantless** arrests and deploy 280 armed troops to the national assembly.

Thousands of citizens rushed to the parliament building – some helping MPs **scale** its walls to reach the chamber – 190 lawmakers voted unanimously to overturn the decree.

Prosecutors allege Yoon ordered drone flights near Pyongyang in October 2024 in the hope that a retaliatory response could serve as a **pretext** for martial law.

Despite Lee’s calls for unity, the political and social **fractures** exposed during the crisis remain raw.

“Deepening **polarisation** raises serious concerns about the long-term health of Korean democracy.”

In its editorial on Wednesday, the conservative Chosun Ilbo accused the Lee administration of an unprecedented “**rampage** and tyranny” in the way it has governed since taking office.

The liberal Hankyoreh, by contrast, warned that **sluggish** investigations and stalled court proceedings risk enabling insufficient accountability.

“Genuine **reconciliation** and meaningful reforms will be necessary to address the root causes,” she said. “The **trauma** of the martial law episode has left lasting scars.”

Glasses and bowls fell and **smashed** into **shards** on the floor.

On Japan’s one-to-seven scale of seismic intensity, the **tremor** registered as an “upper six” in Aomori prefecture – a quake strong enough to make it impossible to keep standing or move without **crawling**. In such tremors, most heavy furniture can collapse and wall tiles and **windowpanes** are damaged in many buildings.

No **irregularities** were reported at nuclear power plants in the region.

Located in the “ring of fire” arc of volcanoes and oceanic **trenches** partly **encircling** the Pacific **Basin**, Japan accounts for about 20% of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/08/japan-china-radar-fighter-jets-claims

China’s government has **roundly** rejected Japan’s accusations, instead lodging its own **counterprotests**.

A fire-control radar lock signals a potential attack, forcing the targeted aircraft to take **evasive** action.

The Japanese defence minister said on Sunday the incident was “dangerous and extremely **regrettable**”.

“These radar **illuminations** went beyond what is necessary for the safe flight of aircraft,” he said.

China has disputed Japan’s claims as “completely inconsistent with the facts”, instead accusing Japan’s self-defence forces of having “**maliciously** followed and harassed” its Liaoning aircraft carrier group while it was conducting training drills.

The Japan side was “repeatedly sending aircraft to intrude into the exercise and training zones that China had **demarcated** and announced in advance,” said senior Col Zhang Xiaogang.

Chinese state media has also revived a campaign questioning Japan’s territorial claims over the **Ryuku** Island chain, which includes Okinawa.

The record trade surplus comes even as exports to the US have plummeted, a reflection of the **bruising** US-China trade war that, despite a recent cooling, has **dampened** the flow of goods between the world’s two largest economies.

Chinese premier Li Qiang said the “mutually destructive consequences of tariffs have become increasingly **evident**”.

That is because the demand in the US for cheap products has not gone away, and few countries can replicate China’s **mammoth** ability to produce consumer goods at scale at low prices.

Chinese households are keen on saving money, a trend exacerbated by the pandemic and real estate crash in China that **wiped out** many people’s savings.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/10/japan-megaquake-advisory-north-tsunami-fears

Japan has issued a **megaquake** **advisory** after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori.

Damage from the quake was modest – 34 mostly **mild** injuries and some damage to roads and buildings.

In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake in 2011 occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 **temblor**.

The areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 **municipalities** from Hokkaido to Chiba prefecture.

Japan’s megaquake advisory last year contained a lot of scientific **jargon**, worrying and **baffling** many across the country.

Many people postponed planned trips and rushed to stock up on rice, dried noodles, bottled water and **portable** toilets.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/14/hong-kong-opposition-democratic-party-disbands-chinese-pressure

Hong Kong’s last major opposition party has disbanded after a vote by its members, the **culmination** of Chinese pressure on the city’s remaining liberal voices in a years-long security crackdown.

However, mass pro-democracy protests in 2019 against a perceived tightening of China’s grip on the city prompted Beijing to enact a sweeping national security law to **stifle** dissent.

On Sunday, DP members voted to disband the party and to enter **liquidation**,.

Of 121 votes cast, 117 were in favour of disbanding while four were **abstentions**.

Senior party members previously told Reuters they had been **approached** by Chinese officials or “middlemen” and told to disband or face severe consequences, including possible arrest.

There was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Hong Kong **Liaison** Office, China’s main representative body in the special administrative region.

“I find it very **problematic**,” she said.

From 1 January, condoms and **contraceptives** will be subject to a 13% VAT rate.

The measure was **buried** in a VAT law passed in 2024 in an effort to modernise China’s tax regime.

China has over the past decade been introducing a **suite** of “carrots” to **induce** people to have more children.

Provinces have been experimenting with offering discounts on **IVF** treatment. Some local governments offer **newlyweds** extra days of paid leave to encourage people to **tie the knot**.

“What is wrong with modern society? They are truly **going to extreme lengths** just to make us have children,” wrote one user on Weibo.

The new VAT law also includes a **tax break** for childcare and “marriage introduction services”.

Women in some areas have reported receiving phone calls from local government officers asking about their **menstrual** cycles and childbearing plans. The local health bureau said the data collection was necessary to identify pregnant and **expectant** mothers.

“They’ll be calling to urge **intercourse** during the **ovulation** period … this is mass **breeding**.”

It **signified** from the government “what desirable family behaviour should be”.

The rent average **masks** dramatic spikes experienced in some countries. If property has been a lucrative **bet** for wealthy investors, the cost of a home is a financial **ordeal** for millions of people whose incomes have been **outpaced**.

New research reported extraordinary levels of housing **precarity**:

A range of factors is driving the **affordability** crisis. But the biggest structural issue, say experts, is “**financialisation**”. In a shift dating back to the 1980s, many European governments have **disengaged** from direct social housing provision. Home ownership has slumped, even in countries where it used to be an **ingrained** part of the culture.

The resulting crisis is not just a downer for young people still sharing a kitchen with their “full **nester**” parents – it is an **economic drag**.

Essential workers are being **priced out**.

Housing **inequality** is, in some countries, feeding the success of far-right parties that **peddle** a narrative of **zero-sum** competition between migrants and locals for scarce resources. In that sense, housing has become Europe’s political **timebomb**, say experts.

On Tuesday, the European Commission unveiled its first-ever affordable housing strategy, which gives governments more **leeway** to subsidise affordable housing.

They are under mounting pressure to extend **eligibility** beyond just the poorest groups. The fact that the EU is stepping in shows at least an awareness of what is at **stake**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/us-announces-more-than-10bn-of-arms-sales-to-taiwan

Donald Trump made **scant** mention of foreign policy issues. US-Chinese tensions have **ebbed** and flowed during Trump’s second term.

The eight arms sales agreements announced on Wednesday cover 82 **high-mobility** artillery rocket systems. They also include 60 self-propelled **howitzer** systems.

Other sales in the package include helicopter spare parts worth $96m and **refurbishment** kits.

In separate but nearly **identical** statements, the state department said the sales serve “US national, economic and security interests.”

“The ‘Taiwan independence’ forces on the island seek independence through force, **squandering** the **hard-earned** money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a **powder keg**,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.

“This cannot save the **doomed fate** of ‘Taiwan independence’. The US support for ‘Taiwan Independence’ through arms will only end up **backfiring**. Using Taiwan to **contain** China will not succeed,” he added.

But the push towards greater weapons sales has been **impeded** by Trump’s **erratic** stance on Taiwan.

Standing inside the temple armed with buckets of rice, the sound of shouting **audible** over banging drums.

A **scuffle** breaks out, some villagers throw handfuls of rice at the officers, a traditional custom for **dispelling** evil, while others **hoist** religious **artefacts** onto their shoulders and march away, past groups of police and other officials.

The **showdown** happened last month. One commenter wrote: “Oh, even their spiritual **solace** is gone.”

“They are frustrated by the lack of economic opportunity and are more prone to volatile **outbursts**,” Chen says.

Two women are **kowtowing**, a traditional gesture performed by those seeking justice.

Tongxing village is a mountainous community, known for its crops of **bayberries**, a small, **prickly**, red fruit.

Several videos collected by China Dissent Monitor appear to **corroborate** the reports. A report published by Chinese media earlier in the summer detailed an ongoing dispute between villagers and a **limestone** mining company to repurpose their land for a **quarry**. Several villagers signed a **petition** opposing the quarry.

However, the state has the power to **requisition** farmland for commercial development.

After several days of intense clashes, a video emerged of villagers appearing to **overpower** local officials, forcing them to kneel.

There is no evidence that the protests are the result of social **contagion** between different places.

But the rapid increase in protests comes at a time of nationwide **malaise** about the sluggish economy, which may fuel **discontent** across different locations.

Firstly, struggling local governments, which collectively are estimated to be **saddled** with at least 44tn yuan ($6.2tn) of debt, need money for public services and to pay salaries. Even though the property sector has plummeted the seized land can still be used as **collateral** to get new loans.

“Land seizures continue to be a major issue because the country is rapidly **urbanising**,” says Rachel Murphy. “Meanwhile, local government **coffers** continue to rely in large part on converting land use from agricultural to non-farm uses”.

While there is no official data on this trend, **anecdotes** **abound**.

The failure of those people to return to work reflects “the **deep-seated** contradictions in the current employment situation of migrant workers”, wrote researchers from Hunan Normal University.

Some in China talk of the “three no’s” to describe the situation of rural migrant workers: no jobs to find, no land to **cultivate**, no place to go”.

Evidence is generally **scrubbed** from social media.

This year, the government has started **rolling out** new service centres in rural areas staffed with social workers, legal advisers and even psychological **counsellors** to mediate disputes before they escalate.

Myanmar’s military has managed to regain momentum in its battle against a determined **patchwork** of opposition groups, retaking some territory, and pushing ahead with a widely condemned election that begins on Sunday.

It is a **turnaround** for the military, which had appeared so **beleaguered** that some dared to question if it could collapse.

“This is really all China playing a role in **tilting** things in favour of the military regime,” says Jason Tower.

It was anger over the proliferation in scam compounds in border areas that led China to give its **tacit** approval to northern-based ethnic armed groups to launch an offensive against the junta in late 2023.

Earlier this year the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, expressed hope the vote would achieve “domestic peace with a **cessation** of hostilities among parties and national governance based on the will of the people”.

The Union Solidarity and Development party is providing more than a fifth of candidates and running in effect **uncontested** in some areas.

Anti-China sentiment has risen in Myanmar, including a perception that China is **stoking** conflict to increase its own leverage over the country.

“I think what the Chinese will say is that they see the situation as a **dynamism**, that a balance of power will eventually lead to some stability,” she said.

The PLA’s eastern theatre command said it had deployed destroyers, **frigates**, fighters, bombers, drones and long-range missiles “**in close proximity**” to Taiwan.

By Monday afternoon, Taiwan’s defence ministry said it had detected 28 navy and coastguard ships, including two that entered Taiwan’s **contiguous zone**. A formation of four **amphibious** assault ships, which can carry dozens of **rotary** aircraft, was spotted 160 nautical miles west of Taiwan’s southern tip.

“Any sinister **schemes** to **obstruct** China’s reunification are doomed to fail,” Lin said.

“Despite repeated warnings from China, the US and Taiwan engaged in serious **collusion** and provocation.”

A propaganda poster depicted **flaming arrows** shot from China to Taiwan’s main island.

Justice Mission 2025 is the sixth major PLA military exercise targeting Taiwan since 2022, when it launched days of live-fire drills in retaliation for the then US **speaker**, Nancy Pelosi, visiting the island.
