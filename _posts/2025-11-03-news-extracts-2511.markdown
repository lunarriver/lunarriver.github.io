“No line of investigation is being ruled out to clarify this **cowardly** act that took the life of the mayor,” García Harfuch added.

On Sunday, hundreds of Uruapan residents took to the town’s streets to accompany the funeral **procession**.

At the head of the procession, a man led Manzo Rodríguez’s black horse, with one of the mayor’s signature hats placed on the **saddle**. A group of musicians, also dressed in black, followed and played **mariachi** songs.

Whereas Russian crude amounted to virtually all of the STAR refinery’s crude **intake** in October and September of about 210,000 bpd. 

Tupras was also likely soon to completely phase out Russian crude imports so that it could maintain fuel exports to Europe without **falling foul** of the EU’s incoming sanctions.

At least 200 Russian soldiers had **penetrated** Pokrovsk’s defences, Kyiv said last week, while the Institute for the Study of War assessed that others were closing in on its outskirts in a **pincer-shaped** movement.

On Saturday night, Moran Harari urged Israel to **have restraint**.

It is unclear if the Palestinians were **recovered** from Gaza by troops during the war.

Israel’s prime minister said earlier on Sunday that “there are still **pockets** of Hamas” in parts of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces.

The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and **staffed by** medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

Israel, which has denied accusations by a UN commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry’s figures without providing a **contradicting toll**.

The quake also damaged the Blue Mosque of Mazar-i-Sharif, a 15th-century landmark famed for its **vibrant** **tiles**.

Yousaf Hammad said most of the injured suffered minor wounds and were **discharged** after receiving initial treatment.

In Mazar-i-Sharif, footage on social media showed the quake had caused some damage to the Blue Mosque, with AFP reporting that pieces of the **ornate** structure, particularly from one of its **minarets**, had broken off and fallen to the ground.

The **impoverished** country often faces difficulty in responding to such natural disasters, especially in remote regions.

Buildings in Afghanistan tend to be **low-rise** constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and **outlying** areas made from mud bricks and wood.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/xi-jinping-cracks-joke-about-spying-with-phones-given-to-south-korean-president

Xi, who is not known for public displays of humour, laughed and smiled as Lee’s **quip** was translated into Chinese, before displaying some sharp **wit** of his own.

The **lighthearted** exchange took place as Xi and Lee exchanged gifts on the sidelines of the Apec summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju – Xi’s first visit to the country in more than a decade.

The leaders’ conversation, captured by TV cameras, generated huge media interest in South Korea as Xi rarely **cracks jokes**, especially on a subject as sensitive as espionage.

A state media live feed of the **trio** walking into Tiananmen Square caught Putin’s interpreter saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”

“Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and even achieve **immortality**,” he added.

Lee’s spokesperson, Kim Nam-joon, said the moment of **levity** was proof that the two leaders had bonded during several meetings at the two-day summit.

Xi, who like Lee is a **keen** player of the ancient strategy board game, described the board as “**exquisite**”, according to South Korean media.

Here’s what we know so far about the **unfolding** situation.

“If the Nigerian government failed to stop the killings, Washington would “immediately stop all aid and assistance to **Nigeria**” and could “go into that now **disgraced** country, **guns-a-blazing**”.

His statement reflected renewed domestic political pressure to appear tough on the **marginalisation** or persecution of Christians abroad, a theme that resonates strongly with parts of his rightwing, **evangelical** base.

Nigeria is officially **secular** but almost **evenly** divided between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%), with the remaining population practising African traditional religions.

In parts of central Nigeria, deadly clashes between **itinerant** Muslim **herders** and **predominantly** Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water but exacerbated by religious and ethnic differences. The herders often claim reprisals for the killing of their people and **cattle**, while local communities see the attacks as ethnic cleansing targeting their settlements.

**Priests** and **pastors** have increasingly been kidnapped for **ransom**.

In the north-east, Boko Haram and its **splinter groups** such as Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have waged an insurgency since 2009, killing tens of thousands and displacing millions.

In the north-west, heavily armed criminal gangs – often labelled “**bandits**” – carry out mass kidnappings and raids that affect both Muslim and Christian communities.

Meanwhile, in the south-east, separatists seeking to revive the **defunct** state of Biafra have been linked to violence against government institutions and civilians, with most victims being Christians.

**Vigilante** groups have filled the vacuum in some states.

Meanwhile, his presidential spokesperson, Daniel Bwala, described Trump’s post as “a **miscommunication**”.

“The Shenzhou-20 **crewed** spacecraft is suspected to have been struck by a small piece of **orbital** debris,” said the China **Manned** Space Agency in a statement.

Authorities didn’t say when the incident is believed to have occurred. There was no indication of any issues earlier this week, with state media reporting on the two crews enjoying a meal of **baked** chicken cooked on the space station’s first ever oven, delivered by the Shenzhou-21 team.

“Shenzhou-22 and the Long March 2F (launcher) were already on **standby**.

The returning Shenzhou-20 team’s commander, Chen Dong, already holds a Chinese record for the longest **cumulative** spaceflight.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-visits-troops-near-embattled-pokrovsk

Russian forces had pushed further into Pokrovsk and its **environs**.

The city administration reported an explosion at the Sterlitamak Petrochemical Plant that caused its water **treatment** facility to partially collapse. The Ukrainian military general staff said there was “**considerable** damage” to the plant.

Russian military **reservists** will now have to guard oil refineries against Ukrainian drone strikes after Vladimir Putin signed a law on Tuesday extending their **entanglement** in the war effort. The Russian ruler also signed a law allowing military **conscription** all year round whereas previously it was possible only during limited periods in autumn and spring.

Italy summoned Russia’s deputy ambassador on Tuesday to protest at what it said were “**vulgar**”, “disturbing” and “unacceptable” remarks by Moscow’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who linked the deadly collapse of a tower in Rome to Italy’s military support for Ukraine. “Italy will not alter its foreign policy stance or its principles in response to reckless **verbal** attacks”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/malaysia-defends-trump-us-trade-deal

Among the critics of the deal is former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who said **provisions** in the agreement amounted to “handing over” the country’s independence.

But public **discourse** has centred on an article of the agreement published by the White House.

“With this US deal, Malaysia will now have to work extra hard to ensure it isn’t **ensnared** in other countries’ restrictions” Noor said, adding that the country would also have to be “**diligent** about not **sleepwalking** into long-term, strategic alignment against its own interests.”

The investment, trade and industry ministry was quick to create a **microsite** and release a 15-page Frequently Released Questions (FAQs) to address concerns.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/japan-deploys-soldiers-to-contain-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-akita

Unexpected encounters with bears are being reported almost daily in the lead up to hibernation season as the animals **forage** for food.

Officials say the soldiers will not use firearms to **cull** the bears.

Fumitoshi Sato said: “Every day, bears **intrude** into residential areas in the region.”

A team of white-helmeted soldiers wearing **bulletproof** **vests** and carrying bear **spray** and net launchers set up a trap near an **orchard**.

The Japanese self-defence forces are already **understaffed**.

On Wednesday, a woman in Akita city spotted two bears on a **persimmon** tree in her garden.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/philippines-state-of-emergency-typhoon-kalmaegi-death-toll

Marcos’s “state of national **calamity**” declaration would allow the government to disburse emergency funds faster and prevent food **hoarding** and overpricing.

The problems may have been made worse by years of **quarrying** that caused clogging of nearby rivers.

A corruption scandal involving **substandard** or non-existent flood control projects across the Philippines has sparked public outrage and street protests in recent months.

Ferries and fishing boats were prohibited from **venturing** out to increasingly rough seas during the typhoon.

The skies were also closed over Liège airport, an important hub for **freight** transport, leading to further cancellations, delays and **diversions**.

Lithuania closed its two largest airports last month after **helium** balloons, suspected of carrying **contraband** cigarettes. Lithuania’s prime minister later called the **intrusions** “hybrid attacks” in an echo of the term used to describe destabilisation efforts by Moscow.

Belgium’s defence minister said the incidents appeared to be coordinated to **foment** disruption, involving large drones flying in **formation**.

Last week, Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev, known for his **bombastic** social media posts, called Francken an **imbecile**.

The **spat** came after Belgium disappointed EU allies by blocking a plan to loan Ukraine €140bn based on Russian frozen assets held in Brussels.
