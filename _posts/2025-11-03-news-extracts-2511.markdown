“No line of investigation is being ruled out to clarify this **cowardly** act that took the life of the mayor,” García Harfuch added.

On Sunday, hundreds of Uruapan residents took to the town’s streets to accompany the funeral **procession**.

At the head of the procession, a man led Manzo Rodríguez’s black horse, with one of the mayor’s signature hats placed on the **saddle**. A group of musicians, also dressed in black, followed and played **mariachi** songs.

Whereas Russian crude amounted to virtually all of the STAR refinery’s crude **intake** in October and September of about 210,000 bpd. 

Tupras was also likely soon to completely phase out Russian crude imports so that it could maintain fuel exports to Europe without **falling foul** of the EU’s incoming sanctions.

At least 200 Russian soldiers had **penetrated** Pokrovsk’s defences, Kyiv said last week, while the Institute for the Study of War assessed that others were closing in on its outskirts in a **pincer-shaped** movement.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/israel-remains-hostages-gaza-hamas

On Saturday night, Moran Harari urged Israel to **have restraint**.

It is unclear if the Palestinians were **recovered** from Gaza by troops during the war.

Israel’s prime minister said earlier on Sunday that “there are still **pockets** of Hamas” in parts of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces.

The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and **staffed by** medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

Israel, which has denied accusations by a UN commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry’s figures without providing a **contradicting toll**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/afghanistan-earthquake-death-toll-reportedly-damages-blue-mosque

The quake also damaged the Blue Mosque of Mazar-i-Sharif, a 15th-century landmark famed for its **vibrant** **tiles**.

Yousaf Hammad said most of the injured suffered minor wounds and were **discharged** after receiving initial treatment.

In Mazar-i-Sharif, footage on social media showed the quake had caused some damage to the Blue Mosque, with AFP reporting that pieces of the **ornate** structure, particularly from one of its **minarets**, had broken off and fallen to the ground.

The **impoverished** country often faces difficulty in responding to such natural disasters, especially in remote regions.

Buildings in Afghanistan tend to be **low-rise** constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and **outlying** areas made from mud bricks and wood.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/xi-jinping-cracks-joke-about-spying-with-phones-given-to-south-korean-president

Xi, who is not known for public displays of humour, laughed and smiled as Lee’s **quip** was translated into Chinese, before displaying some sharp **wit** of his own.

The **lighthearted** exchange took place as Xi and Lee exchanged gifts on the sidelines of the Apec summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju – Xi’s first visit to the country in more than a decade.

The leaders’ conversation, captured by TV cameras, generated huge media interest in South Korea as Xi rarely **cracks jokes**, especially on a subject as sensitive as espionage.

A state media live feed of the **trio** walking into Tiananmen Square caught Putin’s interpreter saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”

“Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and even achieve **immortality**,” he added.

Lee’s spokesperson, Kim Nam-joon, said the moment of **levity** was proof that the two leaders had bonded during several meetings at the two-day summit.

Xi, who like Lee is a **keen** player of the ancient strategy board game, described the board as “**exquisite**”, according to South Korean media.

Here’s what we know so far about the **unfolding** situation.

“If the Nigerian government failed to stop the killings, Washington would “immediately stop all aid and assistance to **Nigeria**” and could “go into that now **disgraced** country, **guns-a-blazing**”.

His statement reflected renewed domestic political pressure to appear tough on the **marginalisation** or persecution of Christians abroad, a theme that resonates strongly with parts of his rightwing, **evangelical** base.

Nigeria is officially **secular** but almost **evenly** divided between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%), with the remaining population practising African traditional religions.

In parts of central Nigeria, deadly clashes between **itinerant** Muslim **herders** and **predominantly** Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water but exacerbated by religious and ethnic differences. The herders often claim reprisals for the killing of their people and **cattle**, while local communities see the attacks as ethnic cleansing targeting their settlements.

**Priests** and **pastors** have increasingly been kidnapped for **ransom**.

In the north-east, Boko Haram and its **splinter groups** such as Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have waged an insurgency since 2009, killing tens of thousands and displacing millions.

In the north-west, heavily armed criminal gangs – often labelled “**bandits**” – carry out mass kidnappings and raids that affect both Muslim and Christian communities.

Meanwhile, in the south-east, separatists seeking to revive the **defunct** state of Biafra have been linked to violence against government institutions and civilians, with most victims being Christians.

**Vigilante** groups have filled the vacuum in some states.

Meanwhile, his presidential spokesperson, Daniel Bwala, described Trump’s post as “a **miscommunication**”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/chinese-astronauts-delayed-spacecraft-struck-by-debris-tiangong-space-station-shenzhou-20

“The Shenzhou-20 **crewed** spacecraft is suspected to have been struck by a small piece of **orbital** debris,” said the China **Manned** Space Agency in a statement.

Authorities didn’t say when the incident is believed to have occurred. There was no indication of any issues earlier this week, with state media reporting on the two crews enjoying a meal of **baked** chicken cooked on the space station’s first ever oven, delivered by the Shenzhou-21 team.

“Shenzhou-22 and the Long March 2F (launcher) were already on **standby**.

The returning Shenzhou-20 team’s commander, Chen Dong, already holds a Chinese record for the longest **cumulative** spaceflight.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-visits-troops-near-embattled-pokrovsk

Russian forces had pushed further into Pokrovsk and its **environs**.

The city administration reported an explosion at the Sterlitamak Petrochemical Plant that caused its water **treatment** facility to partially collapse. The Ukrainian military general staff said there was “**considerable** damage” to the plant.

Russian military **reservists** will now have to guard oil refineries against Ukrainian drone strikes after Vladimir Putin signed a law on Tuesday extending their **entanglement** in the war effort. The Russian ruler also signed a law allowing military **conscription** all year round whereas previously it was possible only during limited periods in autumn and spring.

Italy summoned Russia’s deputy ambassador on Tuesday to protest at what it said were “**vulgar**”, “disturbing” and “unacceptable” remarks by Moscow’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who linked the deadly collapse of a tower in Rome to Italy’s military support for Ukraine. “Italy will not alter its foreign policy stance or its principles in response to reckless **verbal** attacks”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/malaysia-defends-trump-us-trade-deal

Among the critics of the deal is former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who said **provisions** in the agreement amounted to “handing over” the country’s independence.

But public **discourse** has centred on an article of the agreement published by the White House.

“With this US deal, Malaysia will now have to work extra hard to ensure it isn’t **ensnared** in other countries’ restrictions” Noor said, adding that the country would also have to be “**diligent** about not **sleepwalking** into long-term, strategic alignment against its own interests.”

The investment, trade and industry ministry was quick to create a **microsite** and release a 15-page Frequently Released Questions (FAQs) to address concerns.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/japan-deploys-soldiers-to-contain-surge-in-bear-attacks-in-akita

Unexpected encounters with bears are being reported almost daily in the lead up to hibernation season as the animals **forage** for food.

Officials say the soldiers will not use firearms to **cull** the bears.

Fumitoshi Sato said: “Every day, bears **intrude** into residential areas in the region.”

A team of white-helmeted soldiers wearing **bulletproof** **vests** and carrying bear **spray** and net launchers set up a trap near an **orchard**.

The Japanese self-defence forces are already **understaffed**.

On Wednesday, a woman in Akita city spotted two bears on a **persimmon** tree in her garden.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/philippines-state-of-emergency-typhoon-kalmaegi-death-toll

Marcos’s “state of national **calamity**” declaration would allow the government to disburse emergency funds faster and prevent food **hoarding** and overpricing.

The problems may have been made worse by years of **quarrying** that caused clogging of nearby rivers.

A corruption scandal involving **substandard** or non-existent flood control projects across the Philippines has sparked public outrage and street protests in recent months.

Ferries and fishing boats were prohibited from **venturing** out to increasingly rough seas during the typhoon.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/belgium-to-hold-security-meeting-after-drone-sightings-at-airports-and-military-bases

The skies were also closed over Liège airport, an important hub for **freight** transport, leading to further cancellations, delays and **diversions**.

Lithuania closed its two largest airports last month after **helium** balloons, suspected of carrying **contraband** cigarettes. Lithuania’s prime minister later called the **intrusions** “hybrid attacks” in an echo of the term used to describe destabilisation efforts by Moscow.

Belgium’s defence minister said the incidents appeared to be coordinated to **foment** disruption, involving large drones flying in **formation**.

Last week, Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev, known for his **bombastic** social media posts, called Francken an **imbecile**.

The **spat** came after Belgium disappointed EU allies by blocking a plan to loan Ukraine €140bn based on Russian frozen assets held in Brussels.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/sudanese-militia-group-accused-of-war-crimes-agrees-to-a-ceasefire

Hours before news emerged that the group had agreed to a ceasefire, satellite images appeared to show its **recruits** hiding bodies in mass graves.

The ceasefire agreement is thought to have involved the RSF’s **principal** backer, the UAE.

The RSF appeared to be conducting systematic body disposal, with mass graves being dug in trenches and **pits**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/israel-carries-out-wave-of-airstrikes-on-southern-lebanon

Under the terms of the deal, Hezbollah is to disarm, both parties are **meant to** stop firing on each other.

Thursday’s strikes were unusual in their intensity and for being **preceded** by an evacuation warning.

Lebanon’s government has committed to disarming Hezbollah and ensuring the **monopoly** of weapons lies with the state.

Israel has pressed the Lebanese government to move more quickly on disarmament, but it has said that to do so would risk **inflaming** internal civil **strife**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/ukraine-war-briefing-bulgaria-moves-to-seize-russian-refinery-while-poland-seeks-to-be-us-gas-conduit

With international action progressively choking off Russia’s **petroleum** exports, Poland said on Wednesday that it was working on a deal to import liquefied natural gas from the US to supply Ukraine and Slovakia.

Moscow’s forces appear to be tightening their grip on Pokrovsk, Pjotr Sauer reports, with street fighting **raging across** the ruined city in eastern Ukraine.

Emil Kastehelmi posted: “Ukraine may be repeating a **costly** mistake in Pokrovsk … seen for example in Vuhledar and Kursk – a reluctance to conduct a controlled, militarily **justified** withdrawal from a threatened salient when the situation no longer favours the defender.”

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/mexicans-outraged-by-public-sex-assault-on-president

The groping of Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum by a **drunken** man has sparked outrage among women, many of whom saw their own fears and experiences reflected in her **plight**.

For some women, watching the country’s first female president being **groped** in public was a personal **affront**.

“I felt angry, enraged and **impotent**.”

“The issue of assault is like the base level on the violence **thermometer** and it **culminates** in **femicide**,” said De la Rosa.

The groping incident prompted **indignation** across the political spectrum.

“This assault, this touching that is so **invasive** of our bodies as women.”

Alicia Gutiérrez, a 40-year-old nurse, is **keenly** aware of the dangers facing women on public transport: often, she says, men get just a bit too close and once a man started **fondling** himself in front of her on a bus.

Alejandro Moreno suggested the incident may have been staged to **distract** the public from cartel violence.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/07/chinas-latest-aircraft-carrier-enters-service-to-extend-reach-into-high-seas

The vessel is one of the most high profile signs of his long-running efforts to **overhaul** and modernise the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

The KJ-600 early warning and control plane has been successfully tested during its sea **trials**.

China’s navy said it launched the latest J-35 **stealth** fighter and J-15T heavy fighter from the Fujian.

China’s shipbuilding operates at an **unrivalled** pace but is secretive, and observers **scour** state media alerts and satellite images for signs of the latest developments and innovations.

This year the PLA has been testing several new **barge** ships, designed to create a **loading dock** from almost a kilometre out from shore, to bypass **rough seas** and rocky coastlines.

Taiwan’s defensive strategies had long included plans to move its war planes from the vulnerable west coast to the east, where they were protected by a **mountain range**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/08/taiwan-vice-president-presses-case-at-eu-parliament-for-joint-efforts-to-counter-china

“Peace in the Taiwan Strait is essential to global stability and economic **continuity**, and international opposition against unilateral changes to the status quo by force cannot be **overstated**.”

“In an era marked by increasing **fragmentation**, volatility and rising authoritarianism” she added, to a standing **ovation** in a small chamber of the parliament.

She also mentioned China’s disruptions of global supply chains – likely a reference partly to Beijing’s **throttling** of rare earth exports to the EU earlier this year.

China’s **mission** to Europe on Saturday criticised the EU parliament for allowing her to carry out “separatist activities” in its building despite China’s opposition – adding it had made a **representation** to the European side.

The trip and speech were kept **under wraps** because of security concerns.

Ben Bland said the EU and Taiwan could do much more to deepen ties for mutual benefit in the face of worsening US-China **rivalry**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/09/more-than-100000-evacuated-in-the-philippines-as-fung-wong-intensifies-into-super-typhoon

The super-typhoon crossed over the north of the archipelago’s most populous island, Luzon, with **torrential rain**, sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) and **gusts** of up to 140mph (225km/h).

Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) or higher are categorised in the Philippines as a super-typhoon, a designation adopted to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather **disturbances**.

Warmer oceans allow typhoons to strengthen rapidly and a warmer atmosphere holds more **moisture**, meaning heavier rainfall.

More than 1.2 million people have been **pre-emptively** evacuated across the country.

Earlier on Sunday, Catanduanes was already being **lashed** by wind and rain, with storm surges sending waves **hurtling** over streets and flood waters rising in some areas.
