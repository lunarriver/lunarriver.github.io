#### [2024-04-01 China launches surprise military drills around Taiwan | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/china-launches-surprise-military-drills-around-taiwan)

China has launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan, accusing its leaders of being “separatists” and “parasites” who were pushing the democratically run island into war.

The drills, accompanied by a propaganda campaign, were launched without warning on Tuesday morning. China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said they were a “stern warning” to Taiwan’s democratically elected government over what Beijing claims is separatist activity.

“China’s reunification is an unstoppable trend - it will happen, and it must happen,” Guo Jiakun, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told a daily press conference on Tuesday afternoon.

Forces from the PLA Navy, Army and Rocket Force were approaching Taiwan from “multiple directions”, said China’s Eastern Theatre Command, which manages military operations in the region, on its official WeChat social media account.

It said the drills would focus on “combat readiness patrols at sea and in the air, seizing comprehensive control, striking maritime and land targets and imposing blockade controls on key areas and routes”.

The Command later said China’s Coast Guard was also involved, conducting what it called “law-enforcement patrols” close to Taiwan’s main island. A key element of China’s military advancement has been the integration of non-military arms, including the Coast Guard, and its maritime militia fleet of fishing boats, and the conversion or creation of civilian ships for military transport.

“These drills are concrete actions to exercise legitimate jurisdiction and control over the Island in accordance with the one-China principle,” said Zhu Anqing, a China Coast Guard spokesperson.

Taiwan’s defence ministry said it had detected 71 PLA aircraft and at least 19 Navy and Coast Guard vessels on Tuesday , including the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong. More than 10 of the ships approached close to Taiwan’s contiguous zone, which stretches 24 nautical miles (44km) from the coast, military officials told Reuters. Taiwan’s military had deployed aircraft, Navy ships, and coastal missile systems in response, the ministry said.

Beijing claims Taiwan is Chinese territory and is building capability to seize it by military force. Analysts believe it is not there yet, but has been making significant advances and in the meantime uses military pressure – such as drills – and other coercive means to push Taiwan towards submission.

“‘Taiwan independence’ means war, and pursuing ‘Taiwan independence’ means pushing the people of Taiwan into a dangerous situation of war,” Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office, claimed in a statement.

Taiwan, which is recognised as a country by around a dozen others mostly in the Pacific and Caribbean, operates as a sovereign state with its own democratically elected government, military and currency. Its government and people overwhelmingly oppose the prospect of Chinese rule.

Taiwan’s presidential office spokesperson, Wen Lii, condemned China’s “escalatory behaviour” and “military provocations”, linking it to other recent exercises near Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines and in the South China Sea.

“China’s wide-ranging drills indicate that its ambitions are not limited to annexing Taiwan, but rather aim to achieve **hegemony** in the western Pacific.”

The PLA also bombarded social media with propaganda and nationalistic hashtags, releasing several propaganda videos and posters declaring it was “closing in” on Taiwan, and depicting a full-scale assault on the island including missile attacks. Other imagery called Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, a “parasite **courting** ultimate destruction” and portrayed him as a cartoon bug being held by chopsticks over a burning Taipei. That cartoon, which was in Chinese and English, also showed him holding a former opposition figure, Ko Wen-je, in a cage, in apparent provocation of Taiwan’s **febrile** domestic politics – Ko is now in jail on corruption charges but some supporters have called it a political **persecution**.

China has launched numerous drills against Taiwan in recent years, often in response to **perceived** acts of separatism or pro-independence. Lai, who was elected last year to continue the rule of the pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive party, has taken a forthright approach to cross-strait tensions. Last month he declared China to be a “foreign hostile force” under national security legislation, and announced a series of measures to **counter** its growing influence and espionage operations. His speech and measures were specifically cited in Tuesday’s propaganda.

Amanda Hsiao, a director in Eurasia Group’s China **practice**, said Tuesday’s propaganda “makes it clear that China is breaking from what has been a relatively quiet approach since Trump’s election”.

“This is primarily about Lai’s 13 March speech which Beijing found provocative,” she said. “The publicity around the exercise likely also **has** the US **in mind** – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker and to deter the US from maintaining high levels of support to Taiwan.”

Tuesday’s drills have **differed** slightly from more recent efforts, which have not been so explicitly linked to “punishing” Taiwan. They were also launched with little warning. Taiwan’s government and military have been ramping up their response training amid growing concern that Beijing might launch a real attack or blockade under the **guise** of a drill.

On Tuesday, defence ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang said Taiwan had **elevated** its readiness level to ensure China didn’t “turn drills in to combat” and “launch a sudden attack on us”.

The drills appeared to be of similar size to the PLA’s “Joint Sword” exercises held in 2023 and 2024, but were unnamed, which a Chinese military analyst told state media was a sign of such activity being “normalised”.

The US secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, has visited several Asian countries in recent days, emphasising that countering China and deterring it from attacking Taiwan was a key priority for the US.

#### [2025-04-02 China military drills targeting Taiwan put region’s security at risk, says US | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/us-says-china-military-drills-targeting-taiwan-put-regions-security-at-risk)

The US has accused China of putting the region’s security at risk after it launched a second day of military drills targeting Taiwan with a **rehearsal** blockade and attack.

The China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) began the joint drills without notice on Tuesday morning, sending 76 aircraft and more than 20 navy and coastguard ships, including the Shandong carrier group, to positions around Taiwan’s main island.

On Wednesday, the PLA exercises continued in the central and southern areas of the Taiwan strait, practising hitting key ports and energy infrastructure. In contrast to Tuesday’s drills, the PLA said it would use **live fire** on Wednesday but Taiwan’s defence ministry said it did not detect any near its territory.

“The exercises focus on subjects of identification and verification, warning and **expulsion**, and interception and **detention** so as to test the troops’ capabilities of area regulation and control, joint blockade and control, and precision strikes on key targets,” it said in a statement.

On Wednesday the US state department said it remained **committed** to Taiwan and other allies and partners “in the face of China’s **intimidation** tactics and destabilising behaviour”.

“Once again, China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to **exacerbate** tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk,” it said. “The United States supports peace and stability across the Taiwan strait and opposes unilateral changes to the **status quo**, including through force or coercion.” Japan and the European Union also expressed concern.

“The EU has a direct interest in the **preservation** of the status quo in the Taiwan strait. We oppose any unilateral actions that change the status quo by force or **coercion**,” an EU spokesperson said.

The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said China “firmly opposed” such comments, and that Taiwan was an “internal” Chinese matter.

China’s maritime safety administration announced late on Tuesday a closed zone for shipping due to military drills until Thursday night in an area off the north part of the eastern province of Zhejiang, more than 310 miles (500 km) from Taiwan.

A senior Taiwanese defence official said that was outside Taiwan’s “response zone”.

A statement from the Chinese military later on Wednesday said it had completed its exercises. Taiwan’s defence department said it had detected 23 navy and coastguard vessels, and 36 war planes around the island that day.

China’s Communist party (CCP) claims Taiwan is a province which must be “reunified” with the mainland, and has not ruled out using force to do so. Analysts believe the PLA is not yet capable of the required full-scale invasion, but in the meantime it **routinely** launches grey zone tactics, military drills, economic, legal and cyberwarfare, and disinformation campaigns.

In a series of statements, Chinese government officials have said the drills were targeted at “separatist” activity by Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, who last month designated China a “hostile foreign force” and announced 17 measures to counter its influence and espionage operations.

It also announced a codename for the drills, “Strait Thunder-2025A”, in line with previous drills which contained suffixes suggesting they planned to hold more this year. On Tuesday China’s nationalistic tabloid the Global Times had said these drills were deliberately not named in order to show that such exercises were entirely normalised.

Maj Gen Meng Xiangqing, professor at the PLA National Defence University, told the state broadcaster CCTV: “**As long as** Taiwan independence separatists dare to cross the line, the PLA will definitely act.”

The drills have been accompanied by widely **distributed** propaganda materials, including videos depicting an attack on Taiwan, and a cartoon depicting Lai as a bug being held by chopsticks over a burning Taipei. A propaganda poster on Tuesday was titled “closing in”. On Wednesday a second one was released titled “**paralysis**”.

In the face of growing CCP aggression, Lai has been more assertive in his approach to cross-strait tensions than his **predecessor**. His party – the pro-sovereignty DPP – and the opposition KMT are opposed to CCP rule over Taiwan, although they differ in opinion on how to maintain peace. Taiwan’s public is also overwhelmingly opposed to CCP rule. The CCP, however, claims it has historical sovereignty over Taiwan and that the majority of people – counting the 1.4 billion in China – support “reunification”.
