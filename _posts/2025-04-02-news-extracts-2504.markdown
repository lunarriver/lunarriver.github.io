#### [2024-04-01 China launches surprise military drills around Taiwan | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/china-launches-surprise-military-drills-around-taiwan)

“China’s wide-ranging drills indicate that its ambitions are not limited to annexing Taiwan, but rather aim to achieve **hegemony** in the western Pacific.”

```
The military hegemony of the U.S. is expected to decline in the foreseeable future
```

Other imagery called Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, a “parasite **courting** ultimate destruction” and portrayed him as a cartoon bug being held by chopsticks over a burning Taipei. That cartoon, which was in Chinese and English, also showed him holding a former opposition figure, Ko Wen-je, in a cage, in apparent provocation of Taiwan’s **febrile** domestic politics – Ko is now in jail on corruption charges but some supporters have called it a political **persecution**.

```
Courting life improvement is a major motivation for her to study hard.
```

```
The imposition of martial law led to a febrile political situation.
```

```
He died as a result of persecution by his political rivals.
```

China has launched numerous drills against Taiwan in recent years, often in response to **perceived** acts of separatism or pro-independence.

```
I perceived his enthusiasm for writing.
```

Last month he declared China to be a “foreign hostile force” under national security legislation, and announced a series of measures to **counter** its growing influence and espionage operations.

```
We need to find a way to counter the repercussions caused by his behavior.
```

Amanda Hsiao, a director in Eurasia Group’s China **practice**, said Tuesday’s propaganda “makes it clear that China is breaking from what has been a relatively quiet approach since Trump’s election”.

```
Following China's rapid development, many foreign enterprises are coming here to expand their operations.
```

The publicity around the exercise likely also **has** the US **in mind** – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker and to deter the US from maintaining high levels of support to Taiwan.”

```
We'd better have potential changes in requirements in mind.
```

Tuesday’s drills have **differed** slightly from more recent efforts, which have not been so explicitly linked to “punishing” Taiwan. They were also launched with little warning. Taiwan’s government and military have been ramping up their response training amid growing concern that Beijing might launch a real attack or blockade under the **guise** of a drill.

```
His thoughts obviously differ from ours.
```

```
Under the guise of helping, he actually took control.
```

On Tuesday, defence ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang said Taiwan had **elevated** its readiness level to ensure China didn’t “turn drills in to combat” and “launch a sudden attack on us”.

```
As the rain became heavier and heavier, the government decided to elevate the emergency response level
```

#### [2025-04-02 China military drills targeting Taiwan put region’s security at risk, says US | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/us-says-china-military-drills-targeting-taiwan-put-regions-security-at-risk)

The US has accused China of putting the region’s security at risk after it launched a second day of military drills targeting Taiwan with a **rehearsal** blockade and attack.

```
Their wonderful performance on stage is based on sufficient rehearsals.
```

In contrast to Tuesday’s drills, the PLA said it would use **live fire** on Wednesday but Taiwan’s defence ministry said it did not detect any near its territory.

```
The commander has announced they will use live fire in the drills next month.
```

“The exercises focus on subjects of identification and verification, warning and **expulsion**, and interception and **detention** so as to test the troops’ capabilities of area regulation and control, joint blockade and control, and precision strikes on key targets,” it said in a statement.

```
The headteacher threatened the three girls with expulsion.
```

```
Driving after consuming alcoholic drinks will result in detention as a punishment.
```

On Wednesday the US state department said it remained **committed** to Taiwan and other allies and partners “in the face of China’s **intimidation** tactics and destabilising behaviour”.

```
They are committed socialists.
```

```
Intimidations have no effect on Chinese people.
```

“Once again, China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to **exacerbate** tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk,” it said. “The United States supports peace and stability across the Taiwan strait and opposes unilateral changes to the **status quo**, including through force or coercion.”

```
The president's announcement exacerbated relations with Russia
```

```
We hope that the status quo will not be disrupted.
```

“The EU has a direct interest in the **preservation** of the status quo in the Taiwan strait. We oppose any unilateral actions that change the status quo by force or **coercion**,” an EU spokesperson said.

```
The preservation of one's quality of life is at significant risk if faced with unemployment.
```

```
Coercion is not helpful in establishing relations between countries.
```

Analysts believe the PLA is not yet capable of the required full-scale invasion, but in the meantime it **routinely** launches grey zone tactics, military drills, economic, legal and cyberwarfare, and disinformation campaigns.

```
They held the celebration routinely.
```

Maj Gen Meng Xiangqing, professor at the PLA National Defence University, told the state broadcaster CCTV: “**As long as** Taiwan independence separatists dare to cross the line, the PLA will definitely act.”

```
As long as you remember this chapter, you will achieve a high score in the examination.
```

The drills have been accompanied by widely **distributed** propaganda materials, including videos depicting an attack on Taiwan, and a cartoon depicting Lai as a bug being held by chopsticks over a burning Taipei. A propaganda poster on Tuesday was titled “closing in”. On Wednesday a second one was released titled “**paralysis**”.

```
The deployment of this program is distributed.
```

```
The recent political turmoil has plunged the country into a state of nationwide economic paralysis.
```

In the face of growing CCP aggression, Lai has been more assertive in his approach to cross-strait tensions than his **predecessor**.

```
You have performed much better than your predecessor.
```

#### [2025-04-04 China hits back hard at ‘bullying’ Trump tariffs as global recession fears grow](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/china-donald-trump-tariffs-recession--us-stock-market)

China has hit back hard against Donald Trump’s “bullying” tariffs, raising fears that the escalating trade war could trigger a global **recession** and prompting fresh turmoil in financial markets.

```
The whole world is worried about a potential global recession that may be caused by the tariff wars initiated by Trump.
```

The tariffs “clearly represent a significant risk to the global **outlook** at a time of **sluggish** growth,” said the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva.

```
The outlook for the EV industry is very promising.
```

```
After the pandemic occurred in 2020, global economic growth became sluggish.
```

The UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said ministers would continue to negotiate with Washington, in the hope that the 10% levy on UK exports could be **lifted**.

```
Trump has promised that he would lift the tariffs on countries which did not retaliate.
```

“I would have thought the central expectation now must be that if she is **sticking to** her fiscal rules, she’ll need to increase taxes in the autumn by possibly some significant amount,” said Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
On Wall Street, the tech-focused Nasdaq index entered bear market territory – meaning it has lost more than 20% of its value since the **sell-off** began. It was down 5.8% on Friday alone. The S&P 500 fell 9.1%, its worst five-day trading **stretch since** March 2020.

```
He is still sticking to the decision to give up the opportunity.
```

```
The sell-off has caused the stock market to fall sharply.
```

```
He achieved the best score stretch since the contest's first holding.
```

There was little sign of such **moderation** in China’s **trenchant** response to the Trump tariffs, however.

```
Our response should be moderate.
```

```
The trenchant coverage made him extremely angry.
```

The president has promised voters his “liberation day” policies will bring jobs and investment **pouring back** into the US. But investors fear the higher prices that are likely to result will depress consumer demand in the US, and put the brakes on export-dependent economies worldwide.

```
Please help me pour back the liquid into this bucket.
```

The market **meltdown** has also been fuelled by Trump’s unpredictability, which makes it impossible to forecast whether he will negotiate away some of the tariffs in exchange for **concessions** – or double down.

```
The possibility of a financial meltdown increased significantly due to the tariff wars.
```

```
Unconditional concessions will only lead to further humiliations.
```

“Markets are crashing because markets are based on the stock value of companies who today are **embedded** in modes of production that are bad for the US,” he claimed.

```
This picture needs to be embedded into the wall.
```

Still, in the UK, some economists suggested the tariffs may have only a **modest** impact. James Smith, an economist at the analysts ING, said: “The **overall** hit from tariffs on Britain’s GDP is perhaps only 0.2% or so. Certainly not enough to decisively change the outlook for UK growth. And remember there are some **decent** **tailwinds** for growth this year, notably from government spending.”

```
The growth rate, as expected, is modest.
```

```
The overall profits are quite remarkable.
```

```
He doesn't even have decent clothes.
```

```
Riding in a tailwind is relatively easier.
```

#### [2025-04-05 Trump tariffs come into effect in ‘seismic’ shift to global trade](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/trump-tariffs-come-into-effect-in-seismic-shift-to-global-trade)

US **customs** agents began collecting the unilateral tariff at US seaports, airports and customs **warehouses** at 12.01am ET (04:01 GMT), with higher levies on goods from 57 larger trading partners due to start next week – including from the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate.

Starmer was “clear the UK’s response will be guided by the national interest” and officials would “calmly continue with our **preparatory** work, rather than rush to retaliate”, a No 10 spokesperson said.

Up until now, UK ministers have avoided voicing any criticism of Trump as they sought to secure a trade agreement with the US – hoping for some **exemption** from the tariffs. However, the UK government has drawn up a list of products that could be hit in retaliation, and was consulting with **businesses** on how any countermeasures could affect them.

He said: “The action taken by the US government is completely **illogical**. It will damage the United States itself. It will raise costs in the United States. It will **eliminate** jobs in the United States, it will reduce growth in the United States and we have to make it **abundantly** clear not just that that is going to happen **rhetorically**, but the US has to feel the pain, because ultimately it will be Americans who will persuade their government to stop this foolishness.”

Trump’s announcement of the tariffs on Wednesday shook global stock markets to their core, **wiping out** $5tn in stock market value for S&P 500 companies by Friday’s close, a record two-day decline. The prices of oil and **commodities** plunged, as investors fled to the safety of government **bonds**.

While speaking at a Brookings Institution event on Thursday, Shaw said she expected that over time the tariffs would **evolve** as countries started negotiating lower rates for themselves, but she called the change “huge”.

Shaw said: “This is a pretty **seismic** and significant shift in the way that we trade with every country on Earth.”

#### [2025-04-08 Trump confirms 104% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of unfolding global trade war](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/trump-global-tariffs)

Donald Trump is poised to **unleash** his trade war with the world on Wednesday, **pressing ahead** with a **slew** of tariffs on the US’s largest trading partners despite fears of widespread economic damage and calls to reconsider.

However, Beijing vowed to “fight to the end” after Trump threatened to hit Chinese exports with additional 50% tariffs if the country **proceeds with plans** to retaliate against his initial **vow** to impose tariffs of 34% on its products.

“President Trump has a **spine** of steel and he will not break,” the **press secretary**, Karoline Leavitt, said.

The New Civil Liberties Alliance is a **libertarian** group.

The latest tariffs are higher than the 10% **flat rate** imposed on all global imports to the US on Friday last week and are **tailored** to specific countries based on a formula that has been criticised by economists that divides trade in goods deficit by twice the total value of imports.

Earlier in the day, the FTSE 100 rallied by 2.7% in London, recovering some of the losses it has endured since Trump’s announcement – on what was **dubbed** “liberation day” by his aides – last week. The Nikkei 225 **rallied** 6% in Tokyo. The Hang Seng Index rose 1.5% in Hong Kong.

If they come to the table with **solid** proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals.”

But he again raised the prospect of agreements with countries on Tuesday, **trailing** a potential deal with South Korea.

The president added: “‘**ONE STOP SHOPPING**’ is a beautiful and efficient process!!! China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”

Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, sought to ease concerns about market **volatility**, telling parliament she had spoken to Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, who confirmed “markets are functioning effectively and that our banking system is **resilient**”.

“What we don’t want to see is a trade war, with Britain becoming **inward-looking**.”

China adopted an **altogether** different stance. In a **scathing** editorial, the official state news outlet Xinhua accused the US president of “**naked** **extortion**”.

“**Utterly** **absurd** is the underlying logic of the United States: ‘I can hit you at my will, and you must not respond. Instead, you must surrender unconditionally,’” it said. “This is not diplomacy. It is **blunt** coercion dressed up as policy.”

#### [2025-04-22 Rice crisis: Japan imports grain from South Korea for first time in more than 25 years](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/japan-south-korea-rice-import-crisis)

The quantity of South Korean rice, which was sold online and at supermarkets, is still relatively low at just two **tonnes**, but there are plans to ship a further 20 tonnes in the coming days, the public broadcaster NHK said.

Hirano told Reuters that the price of the Californian product he now served had doubled since his first purchase last summer, but was still cheaper than **homegrown** rice.

And he has had no **complaints** from diners, including Miki Nihei, who was surprised to find out the rice she had eaten wasn’t grown in Japan. “I had no idea,” she said. “I have no **qualms** about eating imported rice. Prices have gone up, so I’m always looking for cheaper options.”

The trend has forced the Japanese government to take the unusual step of **dipping** into its vast rice **reserves**. In March it began releasing 210,000 tonnes of stockpiled rice in an attempt to **arrest** price rises caused by a combination of record summer heat, panic buying and distribution problems.

Japan had previously dipped into its rice reserves in the aftermath of natural disasters or crop failures, but this was the first time it had **intervened** over **distribution** issues.

Japan’s rice stockpiles had already **depleted** after record-breaking temperatures affected the 2023 crop.

#### [2025-04-23 Taiwan president will not attend Pope Francis’s funeral](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/taiwan-president-will-not-attend-pope-francis-funeral)

Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, will not attend the funeral of **Pope** Francis, despite his foreign ministry saying earlier it was their “most important **aim**” in negotiations with the Vatican that he be there in person.

The ministry announced on Wednesday that Taiwan would be sending its former vice-president, Chen Chien-jen as special envoy. Chen has deep ties with the Vatican and met Pope Francis six times, but the decision means Taiwan’s delegation will be without a **serving** government official, despite the Vatican being one of Taiwan’s few diplomatic allies.

Just 12 governments, including the Vatican, recognise Taiwan as a country, and China **lobbies** to keep it excluded from most multilateral **bodies**. As a result there are few opportunities for Taiwan’s president to **mix with** other foreign leaders.

Taiwan’s deputy foreign minister, Wu Chih-chung, had earlier said the government was in talks with the Vatican over Lai’s **attendance**.

“This is the foreign ministry’s most important aim,” Wu said on Wednesday. Wu said the Vatican had “considerations” about whom Taiwan would send, as well as its own “international relations”, but did not go into **specifics**.

“The church has its own diplomacy, I am not allowed to give answers on their behalf,” he said. Wu was speaking outside Taipei’s **Catholic** **Archdiocese**, where he was accompanying Lai on a visit to pay respects to Francis. Lai did not speak to the press.

Later on Wednesday, Wu told reporters that Chen was “the best choice under the current **circumstances**”.

Past leaders of Taiwan have attended formal events at the Vatican. The former president Ma Ying-jeou attended Francis’s first **mass** as pope in 2013. His predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, represented Taiwan at the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, and was seated according to Taiwan’s formal sovereign name, Republic of China.

Taiwan’s ambassador to the Vatican at the time said Chen’s attendance marked the first visit to Europe by a **sitting** Taiwanese president.

China’s government claims Taiwan as a province and does not allow other countries to have formal diplomatic relations with both governments. The vast majority of countries have chosen relations with China, with some having **switched back and forth** amid lobbying and **incentives** offered by both Taipei and Beijing. The remaining 12 allies of Taiwan are mostly small island nations in the Pacific and **Caribbean**. The Vatican is significant as Taiwan’s only ally in Europe, and “the value of being officially recognised by the Vatican is **amplified** by the significant influence it has globally as the head of the Catholic church”, said Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, assistant professor at Taiwan’s National Dong Hwa University, who is an expert on China-Europe relations.

“Taiwan’s fear is that a Vatican-China rapprochement could lead to/**pave** the way to the end of Vatican-Taiwan diplomatic ties, which has put Taiwan’s leadership in a tight spot,” she said.

“Taipei has had good reason to worry about the Vatican’s interactions with China in recent years, which, ironically, have unfolded amid increasing restrictions by the Chinese authorities on religious freedom in the country.”

China’s relations with the Vatican appeared to improve under Francis, who oversaw controversial agreements with Beijing about the appointments of Catholic **bishops** in China. The Chinese government insists that such appointments are a matter of sovereignty and must be government-approved.

Beijing did not issue public condolences to the Vatican until a foreign ministry press briefing on Tuesday.

“In recent years China and the Vatican have maintained **constructive engagement**, conducted useful exchanges, and had extensive communication on international issues,” the ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters.

Guo was asked about Pope Francis’s repeated wishes that he could visit China and meet leaders, and whether breaking ties with Taiwan was a **prerequisite** for this to ever happen with a future **pontiff**. He responded that Taiwan was “an **inalienable** part of China’s territory”.

He would not confirm whether China planned to send anyone to the funeral.
