#### [2024-04-01 China launches surprise military drills around Taiwan | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/china-launches-surprise-military-drills-around-taiwan)

“China’s wide-ranging drills indicate that its ambitions are not limited to annexing Taiwan, but rather aim to achieve **hegemony** in the western Pacific.”

```
The military hegemony of the U.S. is expected to decline in the foreseeable future
```

Other imagery called Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, a “parasite **courting** ultimate destruction” and portrayed him as a cartoon bug being held by chopsticks over a burning Taipei. That cartoon, which was in Chinese and English, also showed him holding a former opposition figure, Ko Wen-je, in a cage, in apparent provocation of Taiwan’s **febrile** domestic politics – Ko is now in jail on corruption charges but some supporters have called it a political **persecution**.

```
Courting life improvement is a major motivation for her to study hard.
```

```
The imposition of martial law led to a febrile political situation.
```

```
He died as a result of persecution by his political rivals.
```

China has launched numerous drills against Taiwan in recent years, often in response to **perceived** acts of separatism or pro-independence.

```
I perceived his enthusiasm for writing.
```

Last month he declared China to be a “foreign hostile force” under national security legislation, and announced a series of measures to **counter** its growing influence and espionage operations.

```
We need to find a way to counter the repercussions caused by his behavior.
```

Amanda Hsiao, a director in Eurasia Group’s China **practice**, said Tuesday’s propaganda “makes it clear that China is breaking from what has been a relatively quiet approach since Trump’s election”.

```
Following China's rapid development, many foreign enterprises are coming here to expand their operations.
```

The publicity around the exercise likely also **has** the US **in mind** – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker and to deter the US from maintaining high levels of support to Taiwan.”

```
We'd better have potential changes in requirements in mind.
```

Tuesday’s drills have **differed** slightly from more recent efforts, which have not been so explicitly linked to “punishing” Taiwan. They were also launched with little warning. Taiwan’s government and military have been ramping up their response training amid growing concern that Beijing might launch a real attack or blockade under the **guise** of a drill.

```
His thoughts obviously differ from ours.
```

```
Under the guise of helping, he actually took control.
```

On Tuesday, defence ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang said Taiwan had **elevated** its readiness level to ensure China didn’t “turn drills in to combat” and “launch a sudden attack on us”.

```
As the rain became heavier and heavier, the government decided to elevate the emergency response level
```

#### [2025-04-02 China military drills targeting Taiwan put region’s security at risk, says US | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/us-says-china-military-drills-targeting-taiwan-put-regions-security-at-risk)

The US has accused China of putting the region’s security at risk after it launched a second day of military drills targeting Taiwan with a **rehearsal** blockade and attack.

```
Their wonderful performance on stage is based on sufficient rehearsals.
```

In contrast to Tuesday’s drills, the PLA said it would use **live fire** on Wednesday but Taiwan’s defence ministry said it did not detect any near its territory.

```
The commander has announced they will use live fire in the drills next month.
```

“The exercises focus on subjects of identification and verification, warning and **expulsion**, and interception and **detention** so as to test the troops’ capabilities of area regulation and control, joint blockade and control, and precision strikes on key targets,” it said in a statement.

```
The headteacher threatened the three girls with expulsion.
```

```
Driving after consuming alcoholic drinks will result in detention as a punishment.
```

On Wednesday the US state department said it remained **committed** to Taiwan and other allies and partners “in the face of China’s **intimidation** tactics and destabilising behaviour”.

```
They are committed socialists.
```

```
Intimidations have no effect on Chinese people.
```

“Once again, China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to **exacerbate** tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk,” it said. “The United States supports peace and stability across the Taiwan strait and opposes unilateral changes to the **status quo**, including through force or coercion.”

```
The president's announcement exacerbated relations with Russia
```

```
We hope that the status quo will not be disrupted.
```

“The EU has a direct interest in the **preservation** of the status quo in the Taiwan strait. We oppose any unilateral actions that change the status quo by force or **coercion**,” an EU spokesperson said.

```
The preservation of one's quality of life is at significant risk if faced with unemployment.
```

```
Coercion is not helpful in establishing relations between countries.
```

Analysts believe the PLA is not yet capable of the required full-scale invasion, but in the meantime it **routinely** launches grey zone tactics, military drills, economic, legal and cyberwarfare, and disinformation campaigns.

```
They held the celebration routinely.
```

Maj Gen Meng Xiangqing, professor at the PLA National Defence University, told the state broadcaster CCTV: “**As long as** Taiwan independence separatists dare to cross the line, the PLA will definitely act.”

```
As long as you remember this chapter, you will achieve a high score in the examination.
```

The drills have been accompanied by widely **distributed** propaganda materials, including videos depicting an attack on Taiwan, and a cartoon depicting Lai as a bug being held by chopsticks over a burning Taipei. A propaganda poster on Tuesday was titled “closing in”. On Wednesday a second one was released titled “**paralysis**”.

```
The deployment of this program is distributed.
```

```
The recent political turmoil has plunged the country into a state of nationwide economic paralysis.
```

In the face of growing CCP aggression, Lai has been more assertive in his approach to cross-strait tensions than his **predecessor**.

```
You have performed much better than your predecessor.
```

#### [2025-04-04 China hits back hard at ‘bullying’ Trump tariffs as global recession fears grow](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/china-donald-trump-tariffs-recession--us-stock-market)

China has hit back hard against Donald Trump’s “bullying” tariffs, raising fears that the escalating trade war could trigger a global **recession** and prompting fresh turmoil in financial markets.

```

```

The tariffs “clearly represent a significant risk to the global **outlook** at a time of **sluggish** growth,” said the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva.

```

```

```

```

The UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said ministers would continue to negotiate with Washington, in the hope that the 10% levy on UK exports could be **lifted**.

```

```

“I would have thought the central expectation now must be that if she is **sticking to** her fiscal rules, she’ll need to increase taxes in the autumn by possibly some significant amount,” said Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
On Wall Street, the tech-focused Nasdaq index entered bear market territory – meaning it has lost more than 20% of its value since the **sell-off** began. It was down 5.8% on Friday alone. The S&P 500 fell 9.1%, its worst five-day trading **stretch since** March 2020.

```

```

```

```

```

```

There was little sign of such **moderation** in China’s **trenchant** response to the Trump tariffs, however.

```

```

```

```

The president has promised voters his “liberation day” policies will bring jobs and investment **pouring back** into the US. But investors fear the higher prices that are likely to result will depress consumer demand in the US, and put the brakes on export-dependent economies worldwide.

```

```

The market **meltdown** has also been fuelled by Trump’s unpredictability, which makes it impossible to forecast whether he will negotiate away some of the tariffs in exchange for **concessions** – or double down.

```

```

```

```

“Markets are crashing because markets are based on the stock value of companies who today are **embedded** in modes of production that are bad for the US,” he claimed.

```

```

Still, in the UK, some economists suggested the tariffs may have only a **modest** impact. James Smith, an economist at the analysts ING, said: “The **overall** hit from tariffs on Britain’s GDP is perhaps only 0.2% or so. Certainly not enough to decisively change the outlook for UK growth. And remember there are some **decent** **tailwinds** for growth this year, notably from government spending.”

```

```

```

#### [2025-04-05 Trump tariffs come into effect in ‘seismic’ shift to global trade](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/trump-tariffs-come-into-effect-in-seismic-shift-to-global-trade)

US **customs** agents began collecting the unilateral tariff at US seaports, airports and customs **warehouses** at 12.01am ET (04:01 GMT), with higher levies on goods from 57 larger trading partners due to start next week – including from the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate.

Starmer was “clear the UK’s response will be guided by the national interest” and officials would “calmly continue with our **preparatory** work, rather than rush to retaliate”, a No 10 spokesperson said.

Up until now, UK ministers have avoided voicing any criticism of Trump as they sought to secure a trade agreement with the US – hoping for some **exemption** from the tariffs. However, the UK government has drawn up a list of products that could be hit in retaliation, and was consulting with **businesses** on how any countermeasures could affect them.

He said: “The action taken by the US government is completely **illogical**. It will damage the United States itself. It will raise costs in the United States. It will **eliminate** jobs in the United States, it will reduce growth in the United States and we have to make it **abundantly** clear not just that that is going to happen **rhetorically**, but the US has to feel the pain, because ultimately it will be Americans who will persuade their government to stop this foolishness.”

Trump’s announcement of the tariffs on Wednesday shook global stock markets to their core, **wiping out** $5tn in stock market value for S&P 500 companies by Friday’s close, a record two-day decline. The prices of oil and **commodities** plunged, as investors fled to the safety of government **bonds**.

While speaking at a Brookings Institution event on Thursday, Shaw said she expected that over time the tariffs would **evolve** as countries started negotiating lower rates for themselves, but she called the change “huge”.

Shaw said: “This is a pretty **seismic** and significant shift in the way that we trade with every country on Earth.”

#### [2025-04-08 Trump confirms 104% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of unfolding global trade war](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/trump-global-tariffs)

Donald Trump is poised to **unleash** his trade war with the world on Wednesday, **pressing ahead** with a **slew** of tariffs on the US’s largest trading partners despite fears of widespread economic damage and calls to reconsider.

The US president claimed “many” countries were seeking a deal with Washington, as his administration prepared to impose steep tariffs on goods from dozens of markets from Wednesday.

However, Beijing vowed to “fight to the end” after Trump threatened to hit Chinese exports with additional 50% tariffs if the country **proceeds with plans** to retaliate against his initial **vow** to impose tariffs of 34% on its products. That would come on top of the existing 20% levy and take the total tariff on Chinese imports to 104%.

The White House confirmed that the higher US tariffs on China would, indeed, be imposed from Wednesday. “President Trump has a **spine** of steel and he will not break,” the **press secretary**, Karoline Leavitt, said. “And America will not break under his leadership.”

The billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk has also reportedly asked the president to reverse course, and the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a **libertarian** group funded by organisations affiliated with conservative businessmen Leonard Leo and Charles Koch, filed a lawsuit against the “illegal” tariffs.

The latest tariffs are higher than the 10% **flat rate** imposed on all global imports to the US on Friday last week and are **tailored** to specific countries based on a formula that has been criticised by economists that divides trade in goods deficit by twice the total value of imports.

After days of turmoil since they were first revealed last week, global markets initially recovered some ground on Tuesday as senior US officials attempted to reassure investors that the new tariffs – including rates of 20% on the European Union, 26% on India and 49% on Cambodia – could be temporary.

But the bounce didn’t last long. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.6%, at 4,982.77 – below 5,000 for the first time in more than a year – as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.8%. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite also came under pressure, dropping 2.2%.

Earlier in the day, the FTSE 100 rallied by 2.7% in London, recovering some of the losses it has endured since Trump’s announcement – on what was **dubbed** “liberation day” by his aides – last week. The Nikkei 225 **rallied** 6% in Tokyo. The Hang Seng Index rose 1.5% in Hong Kong.

Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, has insisted the new tariffs are at “maximum” levels, and expressed confidence that negotiations will bring them down.

“I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits [with the US] come forward very quickly,” he told CNBC, the financial news network, on Tuesday. “If they come to the table with **solid** proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals.”

Trump was asked on Monday whether the tariffs set the stage for negotiations with countries, or were permanent. “Well, it can both be true,” he told reporters. “There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations.”

But he again raised the prospect of agreements with countries on Tuesday, **trailing** a potential deal with South Korea.

“Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the US, and things are looking good,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States.”

The president added: “‘**ONE STOP SHOPPING**’ is a beautiful and efficient process!!! China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”

Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, sought to ease concerns about market **volatility**, telling parliament she had spoken to Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, who confirmed “markets are functioning effectively and that our banking system is **resilient**”.

A trade war “is in nobody’s interest”, Reeves argued, confirming that the UK was seeking to negotiate a new deal with the US. Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on UK exports, in line with the minimum benchmark introduced at the weekend.

She declined to back calls from Liberal Democrats for the government to launch a “buy British” campaign. “In terms of buying British, I think everyone will make their own decisions,” Reeves said. “What we don’t want to see is a trade war, with Britain becoming **inward-looking**.”

China adopted an **altogether** different stance. In a **scathing** editorial, the official state news outlet Xinhua accused the US president of “**naked** **extortion**”.

“**Utterly** **absurd** is the underlying logic of the United States: ‘I can hit you at my will, and you must not respond. Instead, you must surrender unconditionally,’” it said. “This is not diplomacy. It is **blunt** coercion dressed up as policy.”

On social media a 1987 speech by Ronald Reagan posted by China’s foreign ministry has been widely shared. The video clip, in which the former US president criticises the use of tariffs as leading to retaliation and ultimately hurting the US economy, “has a new meaning in 2025”, China’s the Paper said.

Bessent argued on Tuesday that China was making a “big mistake” by daring to retaliate. “They’re playing with a pair of twos,” he claimed on CNBC. “What do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? We export one-fifth to them of what they export to us, so that is a losing hand for them.”
