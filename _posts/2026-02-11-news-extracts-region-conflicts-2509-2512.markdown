### Venezuela

#### [Venezuela says 11 killed in US boat strike were not gang members amid reports vessel was returning to shore | Venezuela | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/11/venezuela-boat-strike-tren-de-aragua-trump)

The emerging details came as several senators, Democrats and some Republicans, indicated dissatisfaction with the administration’s **rationale** and questioned the legality of the action.

Kelly also said Nicolás Maduro was not the legitimate president of Venezuela and that he was a “**fugitive**”.

“This strike sent a clear message: If you traffic drugs toward our shores, the United States military will use every tool at our **disposal** to stop you cold,“ chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said.

The exercise ordered by Maduro as commander-in-chief was **baptised** “Sovereign Caribbean”, said the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López.

“There will be air defence deployments with armed drones, surveillance drones, submarine drones ... We are going to implement electronic warfare actions,” he said on Wednesday, citing the “threatening, **vulgar** voice” of the US.

The US government has released videos of two of the boat strikes and claims it has **irrefutable** evidence the people killed were US-bound traffickers, without providing details to back up the claims.

On Sunday, Maduro, without mentioning Machado’s prize, referred to the 58-year-old **laureate** as a “**demonic** witch”, a term often used by the government.

“We want peace, and we will have peace, but peace with freedom, with sovereignty,” Maduro said at an event commemorating the discovery of the Americas, celebrated in Venezuela as **Indigenous** Resistance Day.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/24/venezuela-maduro-us-drug-cartel-terrorism

Venezuela’s government has accused the US of **peddling** “ridiculous **hogwash**” about its supposed role in sponsoring “narco-terrorism”.

Observers believe Monday’s decision by the state department – which accuses Maduro of leading the **putative** Cartel of the Suns – could open the door for some kind of imminent US military intervention on Venezuela soil.

It said the supposed cartel was “nonexistent” and called the US accusations “**slander**”.

“If the US launches a military intervention in Venezuela, it would mark the first interstate war by the United States in South America,” the group wrote, noting how past US military operations in Latin America linked to the “war on drugs” had “delivered not security but a torrent of bloodshed, **dispossession**, and destabilisation”.

**Clad** in **woodland** **camouflage** **fatigues**, Maduro told a rally in the capital, Caracas.

“Maduro and most of his cohorts view the US military threats as a **bluff**.”

It believed “**deposing** Maduro is in the US national interest”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/pentagon-wont-release-full-video-caribbean-attack

Trump at one point supported making the footage public but later backtracked and **deferred to** Hegseth.

“How can you trust their transparency on all the other issues **swirling** about in the Caribbean?”

“It is hard to **square** the widespread **routine** prompt posting of detailed videos of every stripe with a concern that posting a portion of the video of the first strike would violate a variety of classification concerns.”

“Keep in mind, we have an obligation to send a team to **interdict**,” he said.

“Interdicting a vessel underway, is perhaps the most dangerous mission we have in our entire military **inventory**.”

### Thailand and Cambodia

Law enforcement agencies have yet to arrest the suspected masterminds of the **lucrative** networks.

Another alleged scam operation involved Yim Leak, who Thai authorities described as “the heir of an influential network in Cambodia” that conducted **fraudulent** transactions.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/08/thailand-airstrikes-disputed-border-cambodia

Gen Chaiyapruek Duangprapat, the Thai army’s chief of staff, said it was seeking to cripple Cambodia’s military capability, with the aim of **neutralising** it as a threat in the long term.

“However, Thailand will not tolerate violations of its sovereignty and will proceed rationally and with **due regard** for the principles of peace, security and humanity,” he said.

The Malaysian prime minister warned that the fighting risked “**unravelling** the careful work that has gone into stabilising relations between the two neighbours”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/fatal-thailand-cambodia-clashes-spread-along-contested-border-area

Cambodia said “renewed aggression” by Thailand had “destroyed infrastructure, damaged temples, **cultural property**, human heritage and disrupted essential public services”.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/24/why-thailand-cambodia-border-clash-conflict

An enhanced ceasefire agreement was officially signed six weeks ago in Trump’s **presence**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/10/trump-says-end-hostilities-thailand-cambodia

Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, the US president reiterated his global peacemaking skills, **proclaiming** that “in ten months I ended eight wars”.

Tensions have **simmered** since Thailand suspended de-escalation measures in November after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/12/thailand-set-for-early-elections-cambodia-clashes

He is Thailand’s third prime minister since August 2023, and political instability is **taking a toll** on south-east Asia’s second-largest economy.

“When the People’s party couldn’t get what they want, they said they will submit a **no-confidence** motion and asked the PM to dissolve parliament immediately,” Siripong said.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/12/thailand-and-cambodia-agree-to-restart-ceasefire-brokered-by-us-says-trump

Cambodia announced it had suspended all **border crossings** with Thailand.

Trump’s ceasefire announcement on Friday was met with a **tepid** reaction by leaders from both countries.

“We regret and we’re disappointed that some of the points made by President Trump have **bearing upon** the feeling of the Thai people,,” he said.

The roots of the Thai-Cambodian border conflict lie in a history of **enmity** over competing territorial claims. These claims largely stem from a 1907 map created while Cambodia was under French colonial rule, which Thailand **maintains** is inaccurate.

At least six of the Thai soldiers killed were hit by rocket **shrapnel**.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/27/thailand-and-cambodia-agree-immediate-ceasefire-after-weeks-of-deadly-border-clashes

Thailand has also reported 44 civilian deaths from **collateral effects** of the situation.

### Pakistan and Afghanistan

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/heavy-clashes-erupt-along-pakistan-afghanistan-border

“Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and **inflicted** heavy casualties on Taliban forces,” said the statement.

“We will not tolerate the **treacherous** use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan … the state of Pakistan will not rest until the **menace** of terrorism **emanating** from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.”

Pakistan has neither denied nor confirmed carrying out the Kabul strike, only stating that it had carried out “a series of **retribution** operations”.

Gul described the clashes as a “logical conclusion of the tensions that had been **brewing** up between the two countries, particularly after the continuous refusal of the Afghan regime to take demonstrable conclusive action against the TTP, which is spearheading the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.”

Muttaqi said the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border was now “under control” and that allies Qatar and Saudi Arabia had **reached out** to “express that the war should stop”.

He emphasised that while the cash-strapped Taliban in Afghanistan “lacks the capacity to fight the Pakistani military **head-on**”, he cautioned that the strikes could further fuel the cross-border militant insurgency in Pakistan.

“The risk is that its recent strikes in Afghanistan will galvanise TTP to carry out reprisals, which could **invite** further and perhaps more intense Pakistani operations in Afghanistan,” said Kugelman.

Like Ahmed, his uncle was also in the police, a higher-ranking **constable** dedicated to his job, which supported his family of seven children.

The TTP emerged in Pakistan’s **tribal**-dominated border areas around 2007, amid the US-led “war on terror”. After a long and brutal counter-insurgency operation, backed by the US, by 2015 Pakistan’s military had declared a “**phenomenal** success” in eradicating TTP militants from the mountainous border area.

The storming of the federal **constabulary** headquarters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that left six officers dead.

Militants walk openly in residential areas, where they take food from local people and are accused of **extorting** and holding businesses to **ransom**.

Nisar Ali said, the “militants **roam** freely. They ride bikes and **rickshaws** without any fear, not far from the military camps.”

“We see drones flying above our heads but most of the time they kill women, children and the elderly, even our **livestock**, but not the militants.”

A UN report last year accused the Taliban fighters of joining the TTP and the Taliban regime of giving regular aid packages to TTP fighters and a monthly financial **stipend** for its leader, Noor Wali Mehsud.

Muhammad Ali Saif said that this time round, the TTP militants were much more technologically well-equipped – using equipment  such as night-vision **goggles** and sniper weapons.

“If this **bad faith** persists, and this fight spreads to other provinces such as Punjab and Sindh, it will be catastrophic,” he said.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/dozens-killed-afghanistan-pakistan-border-taliban-kurram-chaman-spin-boldak-kandahar-kabul

Pakistan rebuffed the claim as “**outrageous** and blatant lies”.

“We are trying to help people to **vacate** and shift to safer places,” he said.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/afghanistan-earthquake-death-toll-reportedly-damages-blue-mosque

The quake also damaged the Blue Mosque of Mazar-i-Sharif, a 15th-century landmark famed for its **vibrant** tiles.

Yousaf Hammad said most of the injured suffered minor wounds and were **discharged** after receiving initial treatment.

In Mazar-i-Sharif, footage on social media showed the quake had caused some damage to the Blue Mosque, with AFP reporting that pieces of the **ornate** structure, particularly from one of its **minarets**, had broken off and fallen to the ground.

Buildings in Afghanistan tend to be **low-rise** constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and **outlying** areas made from mud bricks and wood.

#### https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/25/taliban-accuses-pakistan-strikes-afghanistan

The fighting ended with a ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey, but talks in Istanbul failed to produce a lasting deal, with security issues, especially Pakistan’s demand that Kabul curb TTP fighters proving a **sticking point**.
