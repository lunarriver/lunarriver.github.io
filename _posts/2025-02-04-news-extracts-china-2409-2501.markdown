### 台海

#### [2024-10-06 Communist China not the motherland, says Taiwan’s president, because our republic is older](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/06/mainland-china-not-the-motherland-says-taiwans-president-because-our-republic-is-older)

The leader **reiterated** his government’s view that Taiwan is its territory.

Lai, who will give his own **keynote** national day address on 10 October, has needled Beijing before with historical references.

#### [2024-10-14 China conducts military drills around Taiwan in warning to island’s president](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/china-military-taiwan-drills-president-lai-national-day-speech)

They were also investigating whether a Chinese man’s attempt to **motor** an **inflatable** **dinghy** to a Taiwanese island a few miles from China was part of the drills.

The ministry of foreign affairs called on Beijing to “pull back from the brink of a **precipice**”.

Taiwan independence and peace in the Taiwan strait are **irreconcilable**.

#### [2024-10-15 From China with love: coastguard’s ‘creepy’ message to Taiwan during military drills](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/hi-my-sweetheart-china-love-heart-propaganda-taiwan)

The image came from China’s coastguard, which ran what it called “law **enforcement** patrols” around Taiwan during Monday’s drills.

Taiwan’s coastguard officials **decried** the image as Chinese cognitive warfare and harassment.

In local news the image prompted headlines. On social media it drew mostly **ridicule** and anger. People found the image “**creepy**”, and comment sections filled with **vomit**-emojis. Some likened the **sentiment** expressed to an abusive partner, while one newspaper called it “sexual harassment”.

Some people **surmised** the reference was supposed to remind people of the show’s star, the local actor Rainie Yang.

China was accused of hacking into monitors at Taiwanese train stations and convenience stores to display messages **disparaging** her.

#### [2024-10-27 China vows to take ‘countermeasures’ over US and Taiwan $2bn arms deal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/us-taiwan-arms-deal-china-vows-countermeasures-nasams)

China will take “countermeasures” to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the government said, **lambasting** a $2bn arms sale package by the United States to Taiwan.

China’s foreign ministry had lodged “**solemn** representations” with the US.

This proposed sale serves US national, economic, and security interests by supporting the **recipient**’s continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.

It would help Taiwan’s air defence capabilities in the face of China’s frequent military **manoeuvres**.

#### [2024-11-07 Anger in Taiwan over reports SpaceX asked suppliers to move abroad](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/space-x-taiwan-manufacturing-claims-elon-musk)

Other suppliers declined to comment or told the Guardian they were bound by **confidentiality** agreements.

Taiwan has resisted foreign **entreaties** to move production overseas, maintaining what analysts have dubbed a “silicon shield” deterrent against a Chinese attack.

Musk seeking to move his supply chain ahead of potential conflict renews focus on his **fractious** relationship with Taiwan, and concerns over how the incoming Trump administration – in which Musk is expected to play a role – will approach the **delicate** situation.

 In September last year he asserted Taiwan was an **integral** part of China akin to the US state of Hawaii, and that it was only “**arbitrarily**” separated because of US protection.

The story has also **garnered** significant attention in China.

#### [2024-12-01 Taiwan president stops in Hawaii during Pacific tour, drawing ire from China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/taiwan-president-stops-in-hawaii-during-pacific-tour-drawing-ire-from-china)

China’s foreign ministry said on Sunday it had **lodged** “serious protests” with the US.

which also includes a stopover in Guam, a US territory.

China has been **exerting** stronger influence.

Speaking to reporters before his **departure**, Lai said: “Thank you to the US government for upholding the principles of safety, dignity, comfort.”

Hawaii’s governor, greeted Lai on the **tarmac** of Honolulu airport on Saturday.

The meeting was a “**momentous** occasion”, highlighting Hawaii’s shared values of **resilience** and **collaboration** with Taiwan.

President Lai’s transit was the highest level of **courtesy** ever, and the level of the **reception** also exceeded previous norms.

China also vowed “**resolute** countermeasures” on Sunday to a recently approved US arms sale to Taiwan.

But the US government is **obliged** by law to supply the island with the means to defend itself.

#### [2025-01-07 Taiwan investigating Chinese vessel over damage to undersea cable](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/taiwan-investigating-chinese-vessel-over-damage-to-undersea-cable)

Open-source marine trackers show it last transmitted its location on Friday morning, in the **vicinity** of the cable.

A Chinese **bulk** carrier was suspected of involvement in damage to undersea cables in the Baltic Sea in November.

Ensuring connectivity is critical for informational operations and **narrative** control, which drives international support.

#### [2025-01-08 The maps that show how China’s military is squeezing Taiwan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/the-maps-that-show-how-chinas-military-is-squeezing-taiwan)

Analysts said China’s **relentless** harassment had taken a toll on Taiwan’s resources, but had failed to convince them to **capitulate**.

He has publicly and **stridently** promised to bring it under Communist party (CCP) control, subsumed into the Chinese motherland, by force if necessary, on multiple occasions.

“**Coercive**” tactics could be a blockade or **quarantine**.

Lee said the PLA was fully capable of those three types of measure but had yet to launch a blockade or attack because it wasn’t yet able to **enact** the fourth: conquest.

Every incident forces Taiwan’s military to respond, wearing down its resources and morale, and **eroding** warning times as Taiwan is forced to shrink the territorial space it can practically cover.

In 2023 it was a similar number, heavily concentrated during military drills launched in April and September in **purported** retaliation to what it called Taiwan’s “separatist activities”.

Lewis’s data, shows a **lull** in ADIZ incursions in the months leading up to Taiwan’s presidential election in January.

Beijing will usually link its drills and greyzone activities to **perceived** provocations.

#### [2025-01-17 Mike Pence to Trump: cutting Taiwan support would ‘likely spark a new nuclear arms race’ | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/mike-pence-donald-trump-taiwan-support-china-relationship-nuclear-weapons)

**Ultimately** nations would feel they have no choice but to develop their own nuclear arsenal.

He pointedly referred to recent comments by Trump that were **dismissive** of Taiwan.

Pence had a **spectacular** falling out with Trump over the certifying of Biden’s presidential win.

Lai is accused of **conspiring** to collude with foreign forces.

### 中美

#### [2024-11-16 The leader says China is ‘ready to work’ with Trump in final meeting with Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/16/biden-xi-jinping-apec-peru)

China is ready to work with the new US administration, so as to **strive** for a smooth transition of the China-US relationship.

While he did not mention Trump by name, the leader **alluded** to the renewed concerns of fresh trade wars.

On the campaign trail, Trump **touted** a hawkish approach to China.

A general backing away from the conflict could give room for China to step up as an **intermediary**, increasing its presence on the global stage.

Their discussions were always “frank” and “**candid**”.

Our two countries cannot let any of this competition **veer** into conflict.

The two leaders **affirmed** the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.

The two countries briefly resumed official-level talks over nuclear arms in November but those negotiations have since **stalled**.

Among Trump’s **blitz** of **cabinet** nominee announcements was the appointments of Florida senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state.

The leader took on a more **foreboding** tone, saying that the world has “entered a new period of **turbulence** and transformation” and **proffered** vague warnings of “spreading unilateralism and protectionism”.

#### [2024-11-20 Trump tariffs are coming, but some Chinese companies may already know how to avoid them](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/donald-trump-tariffs-plan-china-imports-companies-impact-ntwnfb)

But amid the gloom over the **spectre** of a renewed global trade war, some manufacturers may be looking to those who already have a playbook on dealing with aggressive US **levies**, such as China’s solar companies.

More than a decade of US **duties** on Chinese solar cells and panels – which are expected to be ramped up further by Trump – have all but **eliminated** Chinese solar equipment from the US.

This has **spurred** some Chinese companies to rapidly shift and expand their supply chains overseas.

That year, Longi expanded to Malaysia with its first overseas production base, and the launch of a Thai **subsidiary**.

But decision-makers in Washington see the expansions into south-east Asia very specifically as “an attempt to **circumvent** **antidumping** and **countervailing** duties”.

Speaking generally, tariffs “are a bit like **whack**-a-mole”.

Many Chinese **photovoltaic** companies have started exploring new **avenues** for growth, including establishing manufacturing facilities overseas.

It will be nearly impossible for the US solar industry to fully **extricate** itself from Chinese companies.

#### [2024-11-22 Tesla’s path in China clears as Musk courts both Trump and the leader](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/22/elon-musk-tesla-china-us-relationship-trump-xi-jinping)

His commercial and political connections to both may prove **pivotal** as the **feud** between the US and China plays out over the next four years, particularly as Trump promises steep tariffs.

But his relationship with the current US president **soured** over the past four years.

The US-China relationship has been **tumbling** downhill for years.

The country accounts for around one-quarter of Tesla’s global revenues, and the **lion’s share** of vehicle manufacturing capacity.

Trump has promised to introduce 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, **eliciting** **ire** from Beijing and **exacerbating** an already fractious relationship.

I think there are going to be **carve-outs** for Tesla when it comes to tariffs, as well for China.

#### [2024-11-22 US will unveil new export restrictions on China, lobbying group says](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/22/china-export-restrictions)

The Biden administration is set to **unveil** new export restrictions on China as soon as next week.

The new **regulations** could add up to 200 Chinese chip companies to a trade restriction list, according to an **excerpt** seen by Reuters on Friday.

Another set of rules **curbing** shipments of high-bandwidth memory chips to China is expected to be unveiled next month.

#### [2024-11-25 Trump vows 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and deeper tariffs on China](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/trump-mexico-canada-tariffs-border)

China is a major producer of precursor chemicals that are acquired by drug cartels, including in Mexico, to manufacture fentanyl, a highly **potent** synthetic opioid.

“The Chinese side has notified the US side of the progress made in US-related law enforcement operations against **narcotics**,” he said in a statement.

It also said that the Canada Border Services Agency, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and US Customs and Border Protection “work together every single day to disrupt the **scourge** of fentanyl coming from China and other countries”.

Bill Ackman is the chief executive of the New York-based **hedge** fund Pershing Square Capital Management.

But economists widely consider them an inefficient tool that typically leave consumers and taxpayers bearing the **brunt** of higher costs.

The Peterson Institute for International Economics is a **nonpartisan** Washington DC-based research organization.

Analysts said it was probably an opening **gambit**, especially with the Chinese economy in a much more vulnerable position than during the previous trade war waged between the two countries given the country’s prolonged property **downturn**.

#### [2024-11-26 Is the China-US fentanyl pipeline really responsible for the US opioid crisis?](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/26/is-the-china-us-fentanyl-pipeline-really-responsible-for-the-us-opioid-crisis)

However, a presidential statement published last month said the “destructive” trade **deficit**, rather than fentanyl, was the primary driver of the tariffs.

China told me that they would **institute** their maximum penalty, that of death, for any drug dealers caught doing this.

China has **disputed** this **depiction** of the issue.

In 2019, at the **behest** of the US, China scheduled all forms of fentanyl, the only major country to permanently include the drugs on a list of controlled substances.

Chinese and Mexican organised criminal gangs form the financial **backbone** of the international fentanyl trade.

#### [2024-11-29 What are tariffs and how do they work – explained in 30 seconds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/what-are-tariffs-and-how-do-they-work-explained-in-30-seconds)

The artificial increase in the price of imports can also theoretically lead to weaker domestic competition, and local industries that are less efficient and **innovative**.

Tariffs often can **devolve** into a cycle of retaliation, or even a full-blown trade war.

They also aimed to constrain a powerful rival and rebalance a **lopsided** trade deficit.

#### [2025-01-17 Trump says he had ‘good’ call with China’s Xi about TikTok and trade](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/xi-jinping-trump-call)

He is reportedly considering delaying a ban on TikTok which is due to come into effect on Sunday unless the video-sharing app **divests** from its parent company, the Beijing-based Bytedance.

### 外交

#### [2024-11-05 China blocking UK plans in Beijing amid east London mega-embassy dispute](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/china-blocking-uk-plans-beijing-east-london-mega-embassy-dispute)

While the fate of its controversial **mega**-embassy in east London is being decided.

The deputy prime minister faces a politically **fraught** decision.

They see it as a **reciprocal**-type thing where both people want changes.

It was in a **dire** state and in need of major reconstruction.

The FCDO submitted a **procurement** notice in August setting out plans to demolish the embassy in Beijing and rebuild it.

China refused to **appeal** and made it clear to Conservative ministers it wanted them to step in.

The UK government had given its **consent** to this.

Host countries have the international **obligation** to support and facilitate the building of the **premises** of diplomatic missions.

#### [2024-11-12 China must face ‘higher cost’ for backing Russia in Ukraine, says next EU foreign policy chief](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/12/china-must-face-higher-cost-for-backing-russia-says-next-eu-foreign-policy-chief)

She listed Ukraine’s victory as a priority – stronger words than vaguer **formulas** of support voiced by some EU politicians.

In a carefully worded **overture** to the incoming Donald Trump administration, she said support for Ukraine was in the US’s interest.

She said the EU needed “first and **foremost**” to get information from the US on its plans.

These two roles – her position is known as **double-hatted** in EU **jargon** – point to the challenges of the job: touring the globe as the EU’s chief diplomat, while coordinating foreign policy between 27 national capitals that have frequently diverging views, and leading the EU’s **cash-strapped** foreign service from Brussels.

During the Soviet **deportation** of 1941, Kallas’s mother was **deported** to Siberia as a six-month-old baby with her mother and grandmother.

But she faced no specific questions about the EU’s controversial migration deals with Tunisia or Egypt, or the €5bn trust fund for Africa, which aims to deter migration and was recently given an **excoriating** review by the EU’s auditors.
