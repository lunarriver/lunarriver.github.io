### 台海

#### [2024-10-06 Communist China not the motherland, says Taiwan’s president, because our republic is older](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/06/mainland-china-not-the-motherland-says-taiwans-president-because-our-republic-is-older)

The leader **reiterated** his government’s view that Taiwan is its territory.

Lai, who will give his own **keynote** national day address on 10 October, has needled Beijing before with historical references.

#### [2024-10-14 China conducts military drills around Taiwan in warning to island’s president](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/china-military-taiwan-drills-president-lai-national-day-speech)

They were also investigating whether a Chinese man’s attempt to **motor** an **inflatable** **dinghy** to a Taiwanese island a few miles from China was part of the drills.

The ministry of foreign affairs called on Beijing to “pull back from the brink of a **precipice**”.

Taiwan independence and peace in the Taiwan strait are **irreconcilable**.

#### [2024-10-15 From China with love: coastguard’s ‘creepy’ message to Taiwan during military drills](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/hi-my-sweetheart-china-love-heart-propaganda-taiwan)

The image came from China’s coastguard, which ran what it called “law **enforcement** patrols” around Taiwan during Monday’s drills.

Taiwan’s coastguard officials **decried** the image as Chinese cognitive warfare and harassment.

In local news the image prompted headlines. On social media it drew mostly **ridicule** and anger. People found the image “**creepy**”, and comment sections filled with **vomit**-emojis. Some likened the **sentiment** expressed to an abusive partner, while one newspaper called it “sexual harassment”.

Some people **surmised** the reference was supposed to remind people of the show’s star, the local actor Rainie Yang.

China was accused of hacking into monitors at Taiwanese train stations and convenience stores to display messages **disparaging** her.

#### [2024-10-27 China vows to take ‘countermeasures’ over US and Taiwan $2bn arms deal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/us-taiwan-arms-deal-china-vows-countermeasures-nasams)

China will take “countermeasures” to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the government said, **lambasting** a $2bn arms sale package by the United States to Taiwan.

China’s foreign ministry had lodged “**solemn** representations” with the US.

This proposed sale serves US national, economic, and security interests by supporting the **recipient**’s continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.

It would help Taiwan’s air defence capabilities in the face of China’s frequent military **manoeuvres**.

#### [2024-11-07 Anger in Taiwan over reports SpaceX asked suppliers to move abroad](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/space-x-taiwan-manufacturing-claims-elon-musk)

Other suppliers declined to comment or told the Guardian they were bound by **confidentiality** agreements.

Taiwan has resisted foreign **entreaties** to move production overseas, maintaining what analysts have dubbed a “silicon shield” deterrent against a Chinese attack.

Musk seeking to move his supply chain ahead of potential conflict renews focus on his **fractious** relationship with Taiwan, and concerns over how the incoming Trump administration – in which Musk is expected to play a role – will approach the **delicate** situation.

 In September last year he asserted Taiwan was an **integral** part of China akin to the US state of Hawaii, and that it was only “**arbitrarily**” separated because of US protection.

The story has also **garnered** significant attention in China.

#### [2024-12-01 Taiwan president stops in Hawaii during Pacific tour, drawing ire from China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/taiwan-president-stops-in-hawaii-during-pacific-tour-drawing-ire-from-china)

China’s foreign ministry said on Sunday it had **lodged** “serious protests” with the US.

China has been **exerting** stronger influence.

Speaking to reporters before his **departure**, Lai said: “Thank you to the US government for upholding the principles of safety, dignity, comfort.”

Hawaii’s governor, greeted Lai on the **tarmac** of Honolulu airport on Saturday.

The meeting was a “**momentous** occasion”, highlighting Hawaii’s shared values of **resilience** and **collaboration** with Taiwan.

President Lai’s transit was the highest level of **courtesy** ever, and the level of the **reception** also exceeded previous norms.

China also vowed “**resolute** countermeasures” on Sunday to a recently approved US arms sale to Taiwan.

But the US government is **obliged** by law to supply the island with the means to defend itself.

#### [2025-01-07 Taiwan investigating Chinese vessel over damage to undersea cable](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/taiwan-investigating-chinese-vessel-over-damage-to-undersea-cable)

Open-source marine trackers show it last transmitted its location on Friday morning, in the **vicinity** of the cable.

A Chinese **bulk** carrier was suspected of involvement in damage to undersea cables in the Baltic Sea in November.

Ensuring connectivity is critical for informational operations and **narrative** control, which drives international support.

#### [2025-01-08 The maps that show how China’s military is squeezing Taiwan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/the-maps-that-show-how-chinas-military-is-squeezing-taiwan)

Analysts said China’s **relentless** harassment had taken a toll on Taiwan’s resources, but had failed to convince them to **capitulate**.

He has publicly and **stridently** promised to bring it under Communist party (CCP) control, subsumed into the Chinese motherland, by force if necessary, on multiple occasions.

“**Coercive**” tactics could be a blockade or **quarantine**.

Lee said the PLA was fully capable of those three types of measure but had yet to launch a blockade or attack because it wasn’t yet able to **enact** the fourth: conquest.

Every incident forces Taiwan’s military to respond, wearing down its resources and morale, and **eroding** warning times as Taiwan is forced to shrink the territorial space it can practically cover.

In 2023 it was a similar number, heavily concentrated during military drills launched in April and September in **purported** retaliation to what it called Taiwan’s “separatist activities”.

Lewis’s data, shows a **lull** in ADIZ incursions in the months leading up to Taiwan’s presidential election in January.

Beijing will usually link its drills and greyzone activities to **perceived** provocations.

#### [2025-01-17 Mike Pence to Trump: cutting Taiwan support would ‘likely spark a new nuclear arms race’ | Taiwan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/mike-pence-donald-trump-taiwan-support-china-relationship-nuclear-weapons)

**Ultimately** nations would feel they have no choice but to develop their own nuclear arsenal.

He pointedly referred to recent comments by Trump that were **dismissive** of Taiwan.

Pence had a **spectacular** falling out with Trump over the certifying of Biden’s presidential win.

Lai is accused of **conspiring** to collude with foreign forces.

### 中美

#### [2024-11-16 The leader says China is ‘ready to work’ with Trump in final meeting with Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/16/biden-xi-jinping-apec-peru)

China is ready to work with the new US administration, so as to **strive** for a smooth transition of the China-US relationship.

While he did not mention Trump by name, the leader **alluded** to the renewed concerns of fresh trade wars.

On the campaign trail, Trump **touted** a hawkish approach to China.

A general backing away from the conflict could give room for China to step up as an **intermediary**, increasing its presence on the global stage.

Their discussions were always “frank” and “**candid**”.

Our two countries cannot let any of this competition **veer** into conflict.

The two leaders **affirmed** the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.

The two countries briefly resumed official-level talks over nuclear arms in November but those negotiations have since **stalled**.

Among Trump’s **blitz** of **cabinet** nominee announcements was the appointments of Florida senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state.

The leader took on a more **foreboding** tone, saying that the world has “entered a new period of **turbulence** and transformation” and **proffered** vague warnings of “spreading unilateralism and protectionism”.

#### [2024-11-20 Trump tariffs are coming, but some Chinese companies may already know how to avoid them](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/donald-trump-tariffs-plan-china-imports-companies-impact-ntwnfb)

But amid the gloom over the **spectre** of a renewed global trade war, some manufacturers may be looking to those who already have a playbook on dealing with aggressive US **levies**, such as China’s solar companies.

More than a decade of US **duties** on Chinese solar cells and panels – which are expected to be ramped up further by Trump – have all but **eliminated** Chinese solar equipment from the US.

This has **spurred** some Chinese companies to rapidly shift and expand their supply chains overseas.

That year, Longi expanded to Malaysia with its first overseas production base, and the launch of a Thai **subsidiary**.

But decision-makers in Washington see the expansions into south-east Asia very specifically as “an attempt to **circumvent** **antidumping** and **countervailing** duties”.

Speaking generally, tariffs “are a bit like **whack**-a-mole”.

Many Chinese **photovoltaic** companies have started exploring new **avenues** for growth, including establishing manufacturing facilities overseas.

It will be nearly impossible for the US solar industry to fully **extricate** itself from Chinese companies.

#### [2024-11-22 Tesla’s path in China clears as Musk courts both Trump and the leader](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/22/elon-musk-tesla-china-us-relationship-trump-xi-jinping)

His commercial and political connections to both may prove **pivotal** as the **feud** between the US and China plays out over the next four years, particularly as Trump promises steep tariffs.

But his relationship with the current US president **soured** over the past four years.

The US-China relationship has been **tumbling** downhill for years.

The country accounts for around one-quarter of Tesla’s global revenues, and the **lion’s share** of vehicle manufacturing capacity.

Trump has promised to introduce 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, **eliciting** **ire** from Beijing and **exacerbating** an already fractious relationship.

I think there are going to be **carve-outs** for Tesla when it comes to tariffs, as well for China.

#### [2024-11-22 US will unveil new export restrictions on China, lobbying group says](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/22/china-export-restrictions)

The Biden administration is set to **unveil** new export restrictions on China as soon as next week.

The new **regulations** could add up to 200 Chinese chip companies to a trade restriction list, according to an **excerpt** seen by Reuters on Friday.

Another set of rules **curbing** shipments of high-bandwidth memory chips to China is expected to be unveiled next month.

#### [2024-11-25 Trump vows 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and deeper tariffs on China](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/trump-mexico-canada-tariffs-border)

China is a major producer of precursor chemicals that are acquired by drug cartels, including in Mexico, to manufacture fentanyl, a highly **potent** synthetic opioid.

“The Chinese side has notified the US side of the progress made in US-related law enforcement operations against **narcotics**,” he said in a statement.

It also said that the Canada Border Services Agency, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and US Customs and Border Protection “work together every single day to disrupt the **scourge** of fentanyl coming from China and other countries”.

Bill Ackman is the chief executive of the New York-based **hedge** fund Pershing Square Capital Management.

But economists widely consider them an inefficient tool that typically leave consumers and taxpayers bearing the **brunt** of higher costs.

The Peterson Institute for International Economics is a **nonpartisan** Washington DC-based research organization.

Analysts said it was probably an opening **gambit**, especially with the Chinese economy in a much more vulnerable position than during the previous trade war waged between the two countries given the country’s prolonged property **downturn**.

#### [2024-11-26 Is the China-US fentanyl pipeline really responsible for the US opioid crisis?](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/26/is-the-china-us-fentanyl-pipeline-really-responsible-for-the-us-opioid-crisis)

However, a presidential statement published last month said the “destructive” trade **deficit**, rather than fentanyl, was the primary driver of the tariffs.

China told me that they would **institute** their maximum penalty, that of death, for any drug dealers caught doing this.

China has **disputed** this **depiction** of the issue.

In 2019, at the **behest** of the US, China scheduled all forms of fentanyl, the only major country to permanently include the drugs on a list of controlled substances.

Chinese and Mexican organised criminal gangs form the financial **backbone** of the international fentanyl trade.

#### [2024-11-29 What are tariffs and how do they work – explained in 30 seconds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/what-are-tariffs-and-how-do-they-work-explained-in-30-seconds)

The artificial increase in the price of imports can also theoretically lead to weaker domestic competition, and local industries that are less efficient and **innovative**.

Tariffs often can **devolve** into a cycle of retaliation, or even a full-blown trade war.

They also aimed to constrain a powerful rival and rebalance a **lopsided** trade deficit.

#### [2025-01-17 Trump says he had ‘good’ call with China’s Leader about TikTok and trade](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/xi-jinping-trump-call)

He is reportedly considering delaying a ban on TikTok which is due to come into effect on Sunday unless the video-sharing app **divests** from its parent company, the Beijing-based Bytedance.

### 外交

#### [2024-11-05 China blocking UK plans in Beijing amid east London mega-embassy dispute](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/china-blocking-uk-plans-beijing-east-london-mega-embassy-dispute)

While the fate of its controversial **mega**-embassy in east London is being decided.

The deputy prime minister faces a politically **fraught** decision.

They see it as a **reciprocal**-type thing where both people want changes.

It was in a **dire** state and in need of major reconstruction.

The FCDO submitted a **procurement** notice in August setting out plans to demolish the embassy in Beijing and rebuild it.

China refused to **appeal** and made it clear to Conservative ministers it wanted them to step in.

The UK government had given its **consent** to this.

Host countries have the international **obligation** to support and facilitate the building of the **premises** of diplomatic missions.

#### [2024-11-12 China must face ‘higher cost’ for backing Russia in Ukraine, says next EU foreign policy chief](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/12/china-must-face-higher-cost-for-backing-russia-says-next-eu-foreign-policy-chief)

She listed Ukraine’s victory as a priority – stronger words than vaguer **formulas** of support voiced by some EU politicians.

In a carefully worded **overture** to the incoming Donald Trump administration, she said support for Ukraine was in the US’s interest.

She said the EU needed “first and **foremost**” to get information from the US on its plans.

These two roles – her position is known as **double-hatted** in EU **jargon** – point to the challenges of the job: touring the globe as the EU’s chief diplomat, while coordinating foreign policy between 27 national capitals that have frequently diverging views, and leading the EU’s **cash-strapped** foreign service from Brussels.

During the Soviet **deportation** of 1941, Kallas’s mother was **deported** to Siberia as a six-month-old baby with her mother and grandmother.

But she faced no specific questions about the EU’s controversial migration deals with Tunisia or Egypt, or the €5bn trust fund for Africa, which aims to deter migration and was recently given an **excoriating** review by the EU’s auditors.

#### [2024-11-27 Swedish PM says Baltic sea now ‘high risk’ after suspected cable sabotage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/swedish-pm-says-baltic-sea-now-high-risk-after-suspected-cable-sabotage)

The Swedish prime minister declined to **speculate** on who may have been responsible for the severing of two fibre optic telecoms cables in the Baltic last week.

Speaking from the summit, in Harpsund, the Swedish prime minister’s country **retreat**, Kristersson told the Guardian: “The Baltic sea that are dangerous.”

Kristersson’s government **vetoed** plans for 13 offshore windfarms in the Baltic, citing unacceptable security risks.

Kristersson said that Sweden was “safer and more secure” within the alliance than it was before – despite the longtime Nato **scepticism** of the US president-elect, Donald Trump.

#### [2024-11-28 Sweden seeks clarity from China about suspected sabotage of undersea cables](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/28/sweden-seeks-clarity-from-china-about-suspected-sabotage-of-undersea-cables)

There was no explosion or **seismic** signal at all, so that could be consistent with this anchor theory.

In a subsequent incident in the Baltic, in October 2023, the Balticconnector gas pipeline was **extensively** damaged.

They said the damage was being investigated as **aggravated** criminal damage and aggravated interference with communications.

#### [2024-12-22 Let China build electric cars in UK, Tory ex-chancellor tells Rachel Reeves ahead of trade trip](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/22/let-china-build-electric-cars-in-uk-tory-ex-chancellor-tells-rachel-reeves-ahead-of-trade-trip)

China should be encouraged to build electric cars and renewable energy technology in the UK as part of a new **pragmatic** trading relationship that would benefit both countries.

If we are **genuinely** interested in developing trade relationships more to help us achieve stronger growth, then we have to balance the competing interests **proportionately** – security, defence and the desire for growth.

Reeves is desperate to find ways to generate growth in the UK following a wave of gloomy announcements about **stubbornly** high inflation and low growth in the domestic economy.

 This was after its **monetary** policy committee had held the benchmark interest rate at 4.75%.

He said that in 2015, in an attempt to heal a **rift** with China over a 2012 meeting between David Cameron and the Dalai Lama.

With the benefit of hindsight, we **overhyped** the **rapprochement** with China.

As you often do when the **pendulum** has swung too far one way, you push back further than it wants to go.

#### [2024-12-23 Sweden says China denied request for prosecutors to board ship linked to severed cables](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/23/china-refused-investigation-into-ship-linked-to-severed-baltic-cables-says-sweden)

China has notified all **relevant** countries in advance.

#### [2025-01-12 Putin and The leader hold video call in show of unity hours after Trump inauguration](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/21/putin-and-xi-make-show-of-unity-in-call-hours-after-trump-inauguration)

In turn, Beijing has capitalised on Russia’s isolation from the west to secure **preferential** access to its resources and markets.

### 偶发事件

#### [2024-9-19 Tokyo demands answers over fatal stabbing of 10-year-old Japanese boy in China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/19/japanese-boy-stabbed-china)

Japan’s foreign minister, Yoko Kamikawa, has described as “**despicable**” the alleged killing in China of a 10-year-old Japanese boy.

There is concern that the incident could trigger a further **deterioration** in Sino-Japanese ties.

The suspected **assailant** was apprehended by police officers stationed near the boy’s school.

In1931, Japanese troops staged a minor **detonation** on a railway track in Mukden, now Shenyang, as a precursor to Japan’s invasion and occupation of Manchuria.

Relations between China and Japan have worsened in recent years over Beijing’s increasingly **assertive** military activity in waters around Japan.

On Wednesday, a Chinese aircraft carrier and two destroyers entered Japan’s **contiguous** waters for the first time.

Japan has also protested China’s ban on imports of Japanese seafood, imposed after the release of treated **radioactive** water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant began in August last year.

#### [2024-09-20 In Shenzhen, the fatal stabbing of a Japanese schoolboy is quietly mourned](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/in-shenzhen-the-fatal-stabbing-of-a-japanese-schoolboy-is-quietly-mourned?_gl=1*olj03w*_gcl_au*MTE1MzUwOTA1My4xNzI3MDE1NjUy)

One by one, they laid flowers at the gate of a Japanese school in Shenzhen, which was **strikingly** quiet even as nearby streets filled with children heading home from class.

A **trickle** of residents in the southern Chinese tech hub paid **tribute** to a 10-year-old Japanese schoolboy.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, during a visit to Ishikawa **prefecture** in central Japan, said: “Such an incident must never be repeated.”

China **commemorates** the start of the invasion on Sept 18 with air raid sirens and local **exhibitions**. On social media, netizens urged others not to forget this “national **humiliation**”.

These attacks on foreigners have nonetheless stoked fears about growing anti-foreigner and anti-Japanese **sentiments**, which could be spilling over from online **vitriol** into physical violence.

“It is a crime,” she said of the stabbing, tearing up after she offered a bouquet of **chrysanthemums** at the school gate.

These incidents have been widely reported in Japan, further aggravating sentiment towards China, and **expatriates** in China may take steps such as sending their families home.

Both countries must **mourn** the dead and work to prevent a **recurrence** of the incidents.

#### [2024-09-21 Deep regret over fatal Shenzhen stabbing](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202409/21/WS66ee1870a3103711928a9033.html)

**Tragically**, he died at 1:36 am on Thursday after attempts by multiple medical experts failed.

Records show that Zhong was released on **bail** in Dongguan, Guangdong, in 2015 for allegedly damaging public telecommunication equipment.

A senior Shenzhen government official expressed deep regret for the incident and expressed his **condolences** to the family of the boy.

The authorities will get to the bottom of the case as soon as possible and hold the **perpetrator** to account according to law.

#### [2024-11-12 Dozens killed in China after car driven into sports centre](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/12/china-car-driven-into-sports-centre-state-media)

He **rammed** his car into people exercising at a sports centre.

His account posts daily news based on user **submissions**.

Chinese internet censors take extra care to **scrub** social media before and during big events.

The new aircraft **debuted** at the show included the PLA Air Force’s J-35A fighter jets, which appeared in public for the first time.

#### [2024-11-13 As China mourns, some question delay in release of information about deadly car attack](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/13/china-zhuhai-car-crash-tragedy-death-toll-sports-centre)

Questions have **swirled** on Chinese social media about why it took authorities so long to reveal the details.

People flocked to light candles and lay flowers at a **makeshift** **vigil** outside the sports centre.

The Itaewon **stampede** at the end of 2022 was on the [Weibo] hot search for at least a week.

Related hashtags – which **consolidate** popular topics – were restricted.

Foreign media efforts to cover the attack were also **stymied**.

The pilot had forced the Boeing 737-800 plane into its **catastrophic** dive.

Authorities stopped reporting **cremation** figures.

China is grappling with a spate of violent **rampages**.

In September, a man in his 30s killed three people and injured 15, including a **toddler**.

The newspaper made **scant** mention of the deadliest mass violence incident in years.

The phenomenon has generated its own **morbid** internet buzzword: *Xianzhongxue,* or Xianzhong-ology.

It shows a chart that plots *Xianzhongxue* alongside other **contemporary** Chinese phenomena, including *tangping* (lying flat) and *runxue* (emigration).

#### [2024-11-25 Beijing orders investigations into local disputes after spate of deadly attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/25/beijing-violence-stabbings-attacks)

Beijing is ramping up scrutiny of “common” disputes such as those involving marriages and property, the justice ministry said, as the public **reels** from a recent string of deadly attacks.

They would “severely punish major **vicious** crimes in accordance with the law and maintain social stability”.

#### [2024-12-21 Magdeburg mourns Christmas market dead](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/21/magdeburg-mourns-christmas-market-dead)

Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, who came to Germany in 2006 and applied for **asylum** a decade later, was apprehended by armed police in a dramatic **altercation** as shocked bystanders looked on just minutes after the attack.

The battered BMW had **mown** scores of people to the ground.

Abdulmohsen had deliberately turned off the emergency **braking** mechanism on the BMW X3.

An Islamist terrorist had **slammed** a stolen **lorry** at speed into a Christmas market.

People come together for a few days before Christmas … to be together in **contemplation** but also to celebrate.

The **hefty** **bollards** erected around the square, which were disguised as giant colourful lego bricks.

The country is **in the thick of** an election campaign after the collapse of Scholz’s three-way coalition last month over differences in how to deal with **myriad** challenges including a deep economic downturn, and **profound** differences over how to tackle immigration.

But the **chimes** of a church clock continued to ring out with the **melody** of a favourite German Christmas **carol**, a **plaintive** reminder of the celebrations that Magdeburgers had been preparing for just hours before, which were now shattered.

Fan’s “criminal motive was extremely despicable, the nature of the crime was extremely **vile**, the means of the crime were particularly cruel, and the consequences of the crime were particularly severe, resulting in great social harm”, the court said.

A court earlier this week gave a suspended death sentence with a two-year **reprieve** to a driver who injured 30 people when he drove into **elementary** school students and parents. Such sentences are usually **commuted** to life in prison.

Authorities keep a tight **lid** on any reports about the attacks, censoring videos and witness accounts posted on social media.

#### [2024-10-12 China cracks down on Communist party officials for reading banned books](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/china-communist-party-banned-books-rules-xi-jinping)

Several recent corruption cases against officials have included accusations of **procuring** or reading banned materials. The officials have so far received internal **disciplinary** actions.

In September a former **municipal** level official accused of corruption, was also found to have “privately read an illegal publication containing contents that undermined the unity and solidarity of the organization”.

They emphasise **illicit** reading ahead of other crimes like **bribery**.

This image of **infallibility** must not be challenged.

None of the corruption cases publicly reveal what reading materials the fallen **cadres** had accessed.

The leadership has been particularly **noteworthy** for its purges of political rivals and crushing of **factionalism**.

They care enough to say this is punishable **infraction**.

#### [2024-10-23 China cracks down on ‘uncivilised’ online puns used to discuss sensitive topics](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/china-meme-online-pun-crackdown-rules)

Internet regulators have launched a campaign cracking down on **puns** and **homophones**, one of the last remaining ways for citizens to safely discuss sensitive subjects without **recriminations** or censorship.

They also form a hidden **erosion** on the daily communication and ideological values ​​of minors, which can easily lead to **adverse** consequences..

Insulting individuals or China generally is also **frowned** upon.

Colleagues would instead share links to **allegorical** poems or historical references.

They don't allow “obviously ambiguous” new words to spread quickly without “**rectification**”.

The men were **convicted** of **subverting** state power.

The fact that he is going on hunger strike now probably **testifies** to how harshly and badly he is being treated.

In 2009, charges against him for tax **evasion** were dropped, reportedly because of a public **outcry**.

Syrian and Russian airstrikes have **pummelled** areas of northern Syria.

Aleppo is Syria’s second city and a former industrial **powerhouse**.

Assad had remained **conspicuously** absent from public view for several days.

The embattled Syrian leader re-emerged late on Saturday night to conduct a **flurry** of calls to regional allies.

A **concerted** counterattack by the Syrian army appeared to be taking shape.

Israel has rapidly scaled up airstrikes against Iranian targets in Syria over the past year amid increasing regional **confrontations** with Tehran and its proxies.

Assad has **rebuffed** its efforts to secure a political settlement inside Syria.

But Turkey feels Assad has **spurned** talks by setting preconditions such as demanding Turkish troops leave Syria or Ankara end its support for groups such as the Syrian National Army.

This in turn had only deepened Ankara’s fears regarding the **acute** refugee crisis in Turkey.

The danger for the Syrian opposition groups is that they find themselves **marginalised** by the three great powers.

The last meeting made no progress over the basic issues, even the **venue** where the committee would meet.

Jumaa was responsible for **liaising** with the Syrian army.

The UN high **commissioner** for human rights, Volker Türk, voiced concern on Tuesday about the escalation of hostilities in north-west Syria.

The Syrian president has relied heavily on support from Iranian-backed Iraqi militias to keep control of the **fractured** country, which **spiralled** rapidly into a proxy-war.

The insurgents’ sudden sweeping takeover of territory in the north-west, which Zakharova described as “an **audacious** act,” marked the largest challenge to Assad’s rule in years.
